<h2>THE DOMESTIC GRIEFS OF GUSTAVUS M’IVER.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS’S ANTECEDENTS.</small></h3>

<p>In a little house in the Canongate of Edinburgh, there lived, not
very long ago, Mr Gustavus M’Iver&mdash;(for he never would allow himself
to be called Ensign M’Iver, though that was his proper professional
designation),&mdash;as good a man as ever God put breath in, and as faithful
a soldier as ever Lord Wellington commanded in the Peninsula. That is,
doubtless, no small praise to one conceived in sin and brought forth
in iniquity; and heaven knows if it were not as true as Jove’s oath,
it would never have been awarded by us. But he was remarkable in other
respects than being honest; for he was six feet five without the aid
of sock or buskin; and, if any man were to say that he was not four
feet from acromion to acromion, he would assuredly be a big liar. But
it is the head and face of a man that we like to look at; for, after
all, what signifies (except in a warlike view, and ours is a peaceable
one) a cart-load of mere bone and muscle, bound together with thick
whangs of gristle, and yielding nothing but brute force, if it be not
surmounted by a good microcosm of a head, with a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> dial-plate to
let a man know what is going on within. Do we not see every day great
clocks put on the tops of big steeples, and yet, though they are nearer
the sun than the little time-piece with the deuce a body at all, they
go like an intermitting fever, telling us at one time that we are
hurrying to the grave, and at another, that time has nothing to do
with us at all. So is it with men; and, for our part, we could never
discover any proper legitimate sympathetic accordance between the trunk
and cranium of mortals, any more than if (like pins) they had been made
in pieces and one head clapped on a body just as the occipital condyles
suited the straps to which they are attached.</p>

<p>The opinion now expressed is well justified by the example of the
subject of our story; for, while the big limbs of him seemed to
set at defiance all regular laws of motion, either horizontal or
perpendicular, going, as one might say without a paradox, wherever and
however they choose, his head was as methodical as that of a drill
sergeant, and the like of him for regularity might not be seen from
Lerwick to Berwick. Nor was his face ever known to be at fault as a
faithful indicator; and verily there was no great wonder in that, for
nothing short of the pulleys he carried in his brain could ever have
moved a single hair-breadth up or down, to the right or to the left,
the big jaw-bone which he seldom condescended to impart any living
motion to, except at meal times, or when (and that occurred very
seldom) he had an idea to express sufficient in size and importance to
warrant such an excess of labour.</p>

<p>We have said that Gustavus M’Iver had been in the Peninsula; and we
may be believed or not, just as suits the reader’s credulity with
our credibility; but he was a luckless wight who dared to doubt that
fact in the personal presence of the hero himself; better by far he
had been at St Sebastian, for the never a one we ever heard of, that
had the temerity to express any scepticism on the point that did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> not
live to repent it. There can be no doubt, however, on the subject;
for Gustavus was not only in the Peninsula, but he fought there very
well; and no great thanks to him either, for he had the entire charge
of the mess&mdash;a post of honour he had acquired from an indisputable
superiority in culinary lore, and a most indefatigable perseverance as
well as an unexampled adroitness in the art of carving both for himself
and others. The praise he got for fighting was, in so far as regarded
the immense heaps of hungry Frenchmen he hewed down with his falchion,
true enough; the bulletin writer recorded the fact just as it was
reported to him, that the great Goliath Gustavus did actually perform
very wonderful feats of sheer killing; and we cannot help thinking,
notwithstanding of the sneers of his brother officers, that it would
not have become the dignity of a despatch to have made any allusion
whatever to the manner in which he had kept up his body and his courage.</p>

<p>When the war was done, he came home filled with glory; and as, when the
world speaks of a man, it is unnecessary for him to speak of himself,
he seldom (for he was a sensible man) ever thought of speaking either
of himself or any other person or thing. Conceit is the foundation of
speech; where a man is filled to the very throat with glory, there is
little occasion for him ever opening his mouth; and therefore it was
that Gustavus, in addition to his other peculiarities, seldom deigned
to hold converse with the creatures of the earth, unless it were in his
capacity of paymaster of pensions (an office his prowess had secured
to him), when he was compelled to speak, to make others hold their
tongues&mdash;an operation in which he succeeded to a miracle, from the
accumulated load of authority he derived from his silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS FALLS IN LOVE.</small></h3>

<p>Now, it happened that this same Gustavus, after almost all the sap
of his body had been eliminated by fighting, and there seemed to be
scarcely enough left to lubricate the muscles that stretched from
promontory to point of his big bones, like tough hausers, took it
into his head to wish for a wife. We doubt if all the physiologists
or psychologists that ever hunted for traces of the spirit among the
white guts of the head could tell how such an idea came into such an
extraordinary place; and if his heart was as dry as the voluntary
muscles of his body, nothing short of a dislocation of Cupid’s right
arm could ever have sent into such a leathery organ the tickling shaft.
True, however, it is as death, that Gustavus did actually fall in love,
and the symptoms were just as extraordinary as the passion itself;
for there never was heard in any man’s lungs before, such a rattle of
sighs; and as for the length of his jaws, the never a rough wood-cut
of John Bunyan’s hero in the Slough of Despond could come within many
degrees of their lugubrious longitude. It is even true that the power
of the tender passion reached to his stomach&mdash;a place of all others
that might <i lang="fr" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> have been considered perfectly independent of all
moral impulses whatsomever. Nothing before, except hunger itself, had
ever affected that organ; and, indeed, ensconced behind and between,
and beneath such ribs, nothing short of death itself might have been
supposed capable of reaching it, or subduing its tough hide, its
viscous linings, and its gastric juice, stronger than the best gin that
ever was made at Schiedam.</p>

<p>Now the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit bel chose</i> that had thus produced such an effect
upon the moral and physical economy of this big son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> Mars, was
no other than a mere toy of a thing&mdash;a little milliner called Julia
Briggs&mdash;scarcely so big, when divested of the padding and stuffing
with which her art enabled her to supply her deficiency of natural
size, as one of his huge limbs. But this may be no manner of marvel
to those who are versant in the mysteries of love, who, being himself
a small creature, seems to delight in throwing into the smallest of
his victims the greatest portion of his power. It is difficult to see
philosophically any final cause in the curious fact in nature; but
surely, the never a man, who has any observation in him, will deny,
that pigmy beauties and colossal swains (and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>) have a
singular power of producing in each other the tender passion. It may
be owing to nature’s love of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">juste milieu</i>, that thus induces her
to take this mode of keeping up a reasonable <em>mean size</em> among human
creatures, or it may be any one of a thousand other speculations; but
what care we for such theories, when we have the fact to state as an
undoubted truth, that Gustavus fell in love with Julia Briggs, as
standing like a mighty Anak, in the Canongate of Edinburgh, he saw the
little creature skipping along, twisting her little limbs as if she
would have dislocated her joints in her efforts to appear graceful, in
the eyes of mankind generally, and in those of the gigantic Gustavus,
whom she had often seen looking after her, in particular! Successful
beyond any prior example of her wriggling evolution of her graces, the
little baggage&mdash;as quick in her eye as ever were Pip, Trip, or Skip,
the maids of honour (according to Drayton) of Queen Mab&mdash;saw at once
that she had hit the proper twirl and twinkle, at last, that would
subdue the involuntary muscle that had so long been useless beneath
the ribs of the great Gustavus. The moment the effect was produced,
the sinews of his body began to move, and away he stalked after her,
with strides as long as the whole height <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a capite ad calcem</i> of the
quarry upon which he intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> to pounce. It spoke well of the power of
“her harness of gossamer,” that it stood the tug of so huge a victim;
and, as she turned her twinkling eye to observe the triumph of her
power, she did not fail to rivet the chains by some higher displays of
graceful contortion, that made his eyeballs roll in the large sockets,
as if he had seen a hobgoblin, in place of Julia Briggs, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
marchande de modes</i>.</p>

<p>This was just as good a beginning as ever a sly man-catcher essayed
in the world of love, since the days of Helen; and the arch kidnapper
knew very well how to follow up her wile; for, after displaying, by
a proper caper, as much of her ancle as would do the business, she
skipped away, as nimbly as Nymphidia in the service of Oberon’s queen,
and was not again seen till she opened the window of her mother’s
house, and displayed herself, capless and coifless, to her staring
admirer. The capture was now completed. Jove himself was never more
completely entoiled by the chains of the little baggage Iynge; and,
during the whole of that day, Gustavus strode along the pavement,
opposite the window of his charmer, as if he had been on duty before
a besieged city. He had just as little power to walk away as he had
to circumscribe his step to the ordinary measure of God’s creatures;
every stride occupying, at least, four feet of pavement, and being
executed so regularly and methodically, that one step did not differ
from another by a single inch. But it is a mere bagatelle to describe
these pendulous movements, produced, for the first time, by the spirit
of love; while, to execute with truth a faithful picture of the
painful contortions of a countenance originally formed a wood-cut of
extraordinary dimensions, and now under the soft, melting influence of
the tenderest of passions, would require a goose-quill, owning no less
an influence than the spirit of an immortal genius. As the loves of
some of the inferior animals are expressed by sounds and signs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
seem to indicate nothing but fierce war, so might the demonstrations of
this extraordinary affair of the heart, exhibited through the grotesque
motions of muscles that had been as rigid as dried leather for twenty
years, be looked upon as anything rather than signs of the languishing
passion which, as Augustin says, will make a musician out of an ass.
Yet, doubtless, there was, both in his goggle-eyes and lengthened face,
an expression that was intended for softness and languishment; and it
is not impossible, that, if one had been apprized <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> of the
intention, he might have discovered in the ludicrous gesticulations
some resemblance to at least a burlesque of what is only a very
ridiculous exhibition at the very best.</p>

<p>Love that is long a-coming, comes at last with a terrible
onset&mdash;overturning all sense and prudence, kicking up the heels of all
forms of etiquette, and removing every impediment to its progress. It
is but a very small matter to say, that Gustavus could not sleep under
the hug or embrace of the new customer that had taken such a violent
hold of his heart, though we do not deem it an equally insignificant
announcement, that a man who could swallow a couple of pounds of flesh
at a down-sitting, should lose his gustative and digestive powers
to such an extent that the knocking of his heart sounded audibly
through his empty stomach, as if it had been a whispering gallery.
But love is a leveller in more senses than the vulgar one; and the
only circumstance about the matter of this particular case at all
remarkable, was, that such effects, upon a body iron-bound as it was,
and of such gigantic proportions, should have been produced by an agent
of such truly insignificant dimensions. A resolute disciplinarian,
however, at all points, without a single qualm of fear or doubt, and
accustomed to attack a city or a haunch of beef with equal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang
froid</i>, the love-smitten victim, on the third day after his seizure,
drew up his huge limbs to their full extent, till he seemed like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Colossus of Rhodes, and settled the whole affair by one resolute gnash
of his under maxillary bone. Two strides took him to the door, one or
two more brought him down stairs to the street, and the never a man
that stalked off ground that was to be his own, went along with such
strides as he used in making his way to the house of Julia Briggs. With
one solitary idea in his head, and one word on his tongue&mdash;though there
was room for a thousand&mdash;he went direct up to the door, knocked, like
one of Froissard’s warriors at the barricades, was admitted, turned off
the momentous question of marriage by one heavy lurch of his jaw, and
settled a matter that danglers take years about in the space of time
that a thirsty Bacchanalian would occupy in taking a long pull of jolly
good ale.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS IS MARRIED.</small></h3>

<p>In the week afterwards, the couple were united in the holy bands of
matrimony; and, surely, to say that there was any ceremony about such
a union, would be a burlesque of the mysteries of Hymen. Yet, rapid
as were the movements, and wholesale the conclusion, no man ever put
his neck in the noose with such imperturbable gravity, for, during the
whole period occupied by the feast, which was in the form of a supper,
no man could have observed in his gaunt face any one of the three
laughs, Ionic, Megaric, or Sardonic, with which the face is usually
convulsed; the only indication approaching to a cachination in the
midst of the whoops and yells of the feasters, being a grin in the
shape of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">risus Ajacis</i>, that defied all power of analysis. But even
this caricature of a display of good humour, insignificant as it may
seem, shewed to those who knew the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> that he was labouring under
the influence of some extraordinary emotion, as nothing of the kind
had ever been seen in his countenance since the day on which he hewed
down so unmercifully the French at St Sebastian. Nor, on the following
day, when he had fairly entered upon the supreme happiness of the
married state, was there seen any palpable sign of the joy that, of
course, penetrated through all his well-mailed thoracic viscera&mdash;unless
it were, perhaps, that his face had even increased in length, and
the leathery aspect of all the “celestial index” of the soul was, if
possible, more grim than ever.</p>

<p>The getting of a wife is, after all, but a very small matter in
comparison of the ruling of her; and sure, if ever there was a man
in the world, since the days of the grim Hercules, who bungled the
matter out and out, that had any chance of subjecting his wife to the
requisite thraldom and subordination, Gustavus was that man; for a look
of him was enough to tame a Bucephalus any day; and it was evident
that he cogitated mighty achievements in that way, if one might have
judged from the marshalling character of his step as he paraded the
house; his taciturnity, deeper than the wells of truth; and the air of
a resolute importance that was enthroned among the deep furrows of his
extraordinary countenance. The first fruits of his study&mdash;and verily
he must have been a man of no common nerve that could study during the
honeymoon&mdash;was the important conclusion, that the sooner his Julia
was entoiled in the multifarious affairs of domestic economy, and
the imperative duties of ministering to his every want and comfort,
the better chance he enjoyed of subjecting her thoroughly to the
power of his stern discipline. So straight began he, accordingly,
upon the instant, and, by the aid of a small douceur, got quit of his
servant&mdash;an act that savoured of extraordinary sagacity and wisdom, in
so much as it involved the additional advantages of saving her wages,
and keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> and turning his wife into a source of profit, as she would
doubtless be the fountain of much delectation. It is not unlikely that
the maxim, when the devil finds a man or woman idle, he straightway
sets them aworking&mdash;or, as Erasmus expresses it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocium ad omnem
nequitiam impellit</i>&mdash;had a large share in this determination; for, as
to the opinion of Shakspeare, that idleness is the source of love, he
despised it hepatically, and calculated with certainty that love’s
sweetest labour&mdash;the contributing to the comfort of her lord&mdash;would be
diligently pursued by his beloved and most adorable Julia Briggs.</p>

<p>All this was just as fair a piece of human calculation, and as
probable a conclusion, as could ever be found beyond the regions
of pure mathematics; and so, placing every fibre of his big body,
excepting some portion of the heart, under the rigid authority of the
genius of command, he issued, with an air a deuced deal more martial
than marital, his stern orders, which were as recondite as they were
energetic&mdash;going into the very medullary <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penetralia</i> of the matter
of cooking and housekeeping with a knowledge and consideration that
would have done honour to Mrs Margaret Dods of the Cleikum Inn herself.
Nor was this to be much wondered at; for, had he himself not washed
and dressed in the Peninsula, and had he not there also foraged, and
cooked, and swallowed as no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon vivan</i> ever did before, since the
days of the three Apicii? The never a man had ever doubted it; and if
he had, it would just have been as safe for the unhappy wretch to have
disputed his courage as to have expressed one word of scepticism on a
subject that so nearly concerned his honour&mdash;for, in either case, he
would have been knocked down.</p>

<p>It would be a libel on womankind to say, that the <em>polite</em> Julia, who
had been a standing toast among the small men of fashion connected
with the depots of millinery wares about the town, had any affection
for the bare-boned Colossus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> she had wedded on a week’s notice; and it
would have been an insult to her spirit to have said that she feared
him, though he was at least three times the size of any of her former
lovers. She had married him, as all women of her stamp do, just for a
living and protection&mdash;the one to be afforded from his pay, and the
other from his bones and sinews&mdash;a very fair calculation for a woman of
so small a calibre to make; and, accordingly, she would have declared
war against him at once, big and terrible as he was, if she could have
seen any good to come of it; for, as to the fearful expression of
his leather-bound jaws, when he issued the order for work, she cared
no more for it than if it had been a smile of mawkish love-doting.
It is not likely that she had ever heard of Omphale, who ruled the
biggest man of the world by her slipper; but she had not thrown away
the needle, which had been used on the linens of fair, personable men,
to take it up again to sew for a husband that never was intended by
nature to be loved; and, as for supplying its place with the spit, she
looked upon the proposition with as much contempt as she would have
bestowed on a proposal that she should love the gigantic caricature she
had married for nothing else in the world but her own convenience. All
that was as plain as noon-day; but open war was not her tact, any more
than it is the tact of Puck to fight the regular Goliaths of the earth
at a fair stand-up or monomachy; and it is scarcely necessary to say,
that the open <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duellum</i> is no more relished by the women of her class
generally, than it was by the “eel or deil” of a creature that Gustavus
had raised to the high station of his wife. Nor had she any difficulty
in fixing on her plans; for nature was just as kind to her as to the
rest of her sex in suggesting the means of perplexing her lord, though
it is not improbable that, if she had known that his intention in
making her work was to keep her out of all that species of devilry
that comes to women out of idleness, she might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> been inclined to
vindicate the nobility of her kind, by some more devilish trick than
mere unaided nature might at first have prompted.</p>

<p>The sharp, vixen eye of the pigmy sempstress had not been slow in
perceiving that the two grand <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quibus non</i> of her husband’s
comfort, were pure linens and well-cooked victuals; and she knew,
moreover&mdash;doubtless in the way by which the sex come to their secret
knowledge of men’s ways&mdash;that he had been in the habit of securing
these grand objects by the labour of his own hands. The antipodes of
each other in everything, they were as unlike each other in respect
of these domestic duties, as they were in the sizes of their bodies;
for while, as has been already hinted, there never was a man since
the days of Pope Joan that excelled more in the mysteries of washing,
dressing, and cooking than Gustavus, there never was a woman that
knew less of these recondite arts than Mrs Julia M’Iver. The sexes of
the two should, therefore, clearly have been reversed&mdash;he should have
been the wife, and she the husband; and Julia knew this just as well
as we or any other individual who presumes to question the excellence
of the laws that regulate matrimonial matches, when she resolved to
bring about a state of matters that would just be the same as if the
potentiality we have mentioned had just in fact been a reality. She
accordingly began by spoiling every piece of domestic labour to which
she applied her hands; his linens being as much of the tint of saffron
as ever were those of a gareteer, who enjoys the luxury of a pole and
rope put forth from a skylight; and his victuals as wretchedly dressed
as ever a devil-sent cook in the kingdom could have mangled out of the
fair gifts of nature. Nothing in the way of destruction could have been
more skilfully managed; and it is not too much to say, that, though the
fair Julia had lifted her delicate hand, and attempted to knock him
down, or performed any of the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">culpæ gravissimæ</i> that appertain
to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> privileges of the sex, she could not have more effectually
roused the wrath, of the mighty Gustavus.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>GASTAVUS BECOMES HOUSEWIFE&mdash;AND JULIA UNDERGOES A CHANGE.</small></h3>

<p>Had Gustavus been a reasonable man, he might have begun supplying,
in a rational way, the deficiency of domestic lore which his Julia
thus lamentably discovered; but, unfortunately, his pride of the
perfectibility of his own knowledge of these occult mysteries was
called in question at the very time that his anger was roused by a
fault the most heinous of any beyond the pale of the decalogue. With a
look of terrible scorn, in which, all the gristly muscles of his grim
face were called into a grotesque, convulsive motion, he announced,
in as much of a paucity of vocables, and as loud a sound as ever the
stentorian Cycloborus, expressed his settled determination to take the
sovereignty of the kitchen on his own shoulders; and no one could have
heard the sound and seen his countenance without believing that it
was just as sure as death or sin that he would do as he said he would
do. At least, there can be no manner of doubt that Mrs Julia M’Iver
believed him, and it was equally doubtless that she did not fear him.
She smiled at the success of her scheme, and the smile itself would
have done the business of confirmations, if there had been any need
of such aid in the matter. So, accordingly, the apparition was soon
afterwards exhibited, of the great bibbed Gustavus striding about in
the kitchen, and performing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manibus suis</i> all the operations of the
culinary department of his domestic economy; and we would tell a big
untruth, or be guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> misprision itself, if we attempted to conceal
the fact, that he washed and dressed his own linens as well as, if not
a deuced deal better, than any washerwoman that ever danced in a trough
in the village of Duddingstone.</p>

<p>When Hercules laid down his club, and took off his lion’s skin, and
received from the hands of his mistress the spindle and distaff,
the big warrior did no more than many a better man has done when he
resigns himself to the dominion of love; but no love on earth would
ever have made Gustavus M’Iver take upon himself the duties of a woman.
He did it from a sheer love of good eating and clean linens&mdash;ay, and
he persevered in it too, though he saw, as plain as palpable physics,
that (what he dreaded) his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i> Julia would become a prey to the
harpies of indolence. And, to be sure, the ordinary consequences very
soon began to shew themselves; for where there was no love and no work
to occupy the mind, and plenty of well-dressed victuals to fill the
stomach, Mrs M’Iver was, in every respect, a lady at large, and, a
lady at large being synonymous with a lady in danger, she fell into
habits of going abroad, and calling, and gossiping, and sipping, and
tasting, till she became as big a drunkard as ever was seen out of
the county town of Horrestia. Yet, still true to her character, she
feared Gustavus nothing&mdash;no more than she did the good whisky which
she swallowed in choppins; and this fortitude made the mischief ten
times greater than it would otherwise have been; for, terror being the
fulcrum of law and amendment, there might have been some hope of her if
she had not ensconced herself behind the noblest of all the cardinal
virtues&mdash;true blue courage. Though a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite marchande de modes</i>,
and unable or unwilling to cook a dinner or dress a shirt, Mrs Julia
M’Iver knew the rights of her sex just as well as the “guid wife of
Auchtermuchty” herself&mdash;she knew that Gustavus had no right to turn
her away without supporting her, and he could not beat her without
subjecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> himself to the horn of a summons of separation and aliment;
so, upon the whole, she had grounds for her fearlessness, which would
have supported her though she had had never a particle of true heroism
from the mother of every one of us.</p>

<p>Few women whom fame has immortalized, have done so much as was achieved
by this little heroine; for she had already made a giant her cook and
servant, and now she forced him to become her nurse, when she chose to
be sick from the effects of intemperance. A more complete reversal of
all the reciprocal duties of husband and wife, had never been achieved
by woman; and it was in vain that Gustavus looked more grim and gaunt
than ever&mdash;that he even condescended to <em>argue</em> upon the subject&mdash;a
thing he had never before done in his life, and of which, in truth,
he was deemed totally incapable. He still loved the wicked imp, and
she knew he loved her&mdash;and what more was required to account for the
fearless perverseness on the one side, and the submission on the other?
But what was he now to do? It was comparatively mere pastime to cook
or to wash, or even to nurse the sick Julia, when her illness overcame
his resentment; but the thought that the grand qualities and faculties
of a man who had commanded and killed in his day, and whose very look
spread terror around him, were to be brought down to subserve the mere
purpose of ministering to one of the smallest of women that ever drew
breath, and one of the greatest drunkards that ever drank whisky, was
surely enough to make an ordinary man mad. If the difficulty was to be
resolved at all, it could be only by cogitation; and so straightway he
set about a process of thinking&mdash;an operation of marvellous difficulty
to him, as might have been manifestly seen by the length of his stride
and of his face, as he paced backwards and forwards&mdash;his apron, a
species of mail he donned every morning before he began his operations,
shaking and rattling among his huge limbs like a mainsail in a gale of
wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>And, to be sure, his was not altogether a barren cogitation, as might
have been both seen and heard in the loud thunder of his hand on the
table, as he muttered his resolution to stop the supplies. He never
failed to act upon a thought; for the thing was too difficult to be
got, to be lost for want of use, and, accordingly, the supplies were
stopped; but what was that to Julia Briggs, so long as he had any
credit in the town, or she had any clothes on her back? Julia got
intoxicated as regularly as ever she had done before, and demanded
imperiously his ministrations as nurse, with the same <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>,
or rather pertness, that formed a part of her cardinal courage. His
cogitations had gone for nothing; and again the painful duty of
pondering and devising, was forced upon the thick intestines of his
gigantic head.</p>

<p>Again he perambulated the house from room to kitchen, sometimes
brandishing like a sword a spit or skewer, in the mental absence
produced by the effort to think; and he caught at last&mdash;what he
laboured for&mdash;a cure for Julia’s habits of drinking; and he acted upon
it again as manfully as before; for he locked her up, and the devil a
chum, or gossip, or pot-companion could approach her; but he forgot
that there was such an aperture as a window in a house, or a mouth in
a woman, and the first thing that assailed his ears was the cry of
Julia for constables to give her the liberty that our great country has
awarded as a boon to all natural-born subjects of the realm. Nor was
so just an appeal vain; for authorities and neighbours interfered in
behalf of the prisoner; and Gustavus was told to his teeth that he had
not a jot of right to imprison his wife; whereupon she was released,
and the evening of the same day saw her, under the effects of the
jubilee of her emancipation, more intoxicated than he had yet ever
beheld her.</p>

<p>Again was the rusty machinery of his intellect set in motion, and the
result was a device that distanced the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> experiments, as well
for its ingenuity as its chance of success. He had heard of women
being <em>satiated</em> with liquor; and so he put in her power ten times
more than ever it was in the capability of woman to swallow&mdash;an act
that was accompanied by something in the shape of an argument, to
the effect that, if she became disgusted with it, she would give it
up, and if she died of it, the consequence would be the same. The
result in the one case would be an achievement that would bring him
comparative happiness, and the consequence in the other would, he was
now satisfied (such was the misery he had suffered, and was still
suffering), be anything but a misfortune. But Julia took no more
than was good for her, and thanked Gustavus heartily for his extreme
kindness, while every day she applied herself to the big measure; and
every night, while the supply lasted, went to bed with the assistance
of Gustavus’ own hands.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS FALLS UPON ANOTHER INGENIOUS DEVICE.</small></h3>

<p>Thus did matters continue for a long period of time; and all the
efforts, and threats, and devices of Gustavus had no more effect in
preventing Julia from taking her pleasure, than the restraint of
a husband generally has over the irregularities of a wife of true
courage, who knows her inalienable rights derived from the just laws of
a free land. If his brain seemed to be exhausted in devising remedies,
his patience fell a victim before his continued wretchedness&mdash;and no
marvel either, when it is considered that while other men only bring
in the means of supporting a drunken wife, whom the equitable and wise
ordinances of the country will not allow him to get quit of except
for a crime not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> tithe so bad as that of Julia M’Iver, he kept her
in means, and cooked for and dressed for her, and nursed her, and all
the good he got out of her was the liberty of doing these things for
her benefit. By a happy chance, however, Gustavus’ brains were not yet
exhausted. Space and time he had taken to ruminate upon his evils, and
to hit upon one expedient more for the envied cure; and he resolved to
carry his Julia off to the country, where, in some secluded cottage,
he might exercise such an authority over her as would prevent her from
following her usual courses. So accordingly he did just as he had
resolved; and, in a small domicile in a part of the north, he took up
his habitation, for no other purpose in the world than to cure Julia of
her heart-engrained propensity. The place he had chosen seemed the very
choicest that could have been found in all Scotland&mdash;ay, or England or
Ireland either; for there was no house where a gossip might live, or a
whisky-vender hang board, for miles; while a carrier that passed daily
brought him everything that was necessary for human sustenance; and he
himself could cook and wash unseen by the eyes of mortal.</p>

<p>For six weeks was Julia M’Iver as sober as the Chief Justice of
England, or the President of the Supreme Court, and it was manifest
that<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original has extra word 'the'"> never</ins> a drop of anything stronger than river water had got beyond
her parched lips.</p>

<p>Now, Gustavus triumphed as no man ever triumphed under less than an
ovation itself; and Julia was forced to be contented with the limited
tyranny of making him continue his domestic duties; for the more sober
she was kept, the less she would do, and her time was chiefly occupied
in reading novels, which Gustavus was glad to give her as an inadequate
surrogation for whisky. But all this was too good to last, though how
it should be interrupted, no man with less than the spirit of one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Davo
versatior</i> could possibly tell. Jove’s greatness is, however, no less
true, than the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> Gustavus came in one night and found, and
staggered with perfect amazement as he found, Mrs Julia M’Iver lying on
the floor, more perfectly obnubilated, speechless, and senseless, from
the effects of the liquid enemy, than he had ever seen her in his life.
Yet there was no one near; the carrier had not called for a week; she
could not have been absent from the house for more than half-an-hour;
and he himself had been out stalking for exercise, and rejoicing in
his triumph for no more than three full quarters. The matter seemed a
mystery as deep as any that ever was covered by the Eleusinian veil;
and having put her to bed, as he had done a thousand times before,
he set about an investigation and search through all the premises,
which ended in a look of gaunt amazement, and an ineffectual striding
backwards and forwards, till he threw himself on a seat, and gave up
the task in despair. Nor, after he had nursed her into sobriety, could
he make a jot more of the inexplicable subject; for Julia had too much
good sense to tell where she got the treasure, and only smiled at
him as his heavy lips twisted themselves into a question, where, in
the name of the author of all evil himself, she had fallen upon that
infernal element.</p>

<p>No light was to be thrown upon the subject from any of the quarters
from which evidence could have been looked for, and the circumstance
might have remained as one of those mystical wonders that have
perplexed mankind from the beginning of the world, and been passed
over in despair, if Julia had afterwards remained sober, but she had
scarcely recovered, and Gustavus had only begun to hope once more,
when she was found again in the same state; and, every two days, or at
farthest three, she repeated the habit, till at last she was as bad,
if not worse, than she had ever been in the midst of dram shops in the
city of Edinburgh. Never a word of explanation would she give on the
subject; the carrier was watched, and found to deposit nothing; the
inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> at the distance of miles were interrogated in vain; the
house was again searched&mdash;no one had been seen to call, and all was as
obscure as the numbers of Pythagoras, the Bæotic enigma, or the poems
of Carcinus; the deuce a beam of light could Gustavus get for love or
money, to clear up the dark mystery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS IS MYSTIFIED, AND RESOLVES ON A SCHEME PERFECTLY ORIGINAL.</small></h3>


<p>He had now retreated from a bad position to one a mighty deal worse;
for, in the midst of a town, he could sometimes see a friend, and
smoke a pipe, in the fumes of which all his cares were, for a time,
enveloped, and kept from the eyes of his haunted fancy; but now, in
the midst of a comparative wilderness, he had no associate, but that
very limb of Satan herself, that was the source and origin of the
misery to which he was enslaved. He was, besides, rolled up in a cloud
of mystery, in which the wicked enchantress sat and mocked him, like
some of those eastern genii, that love to look and speak through thick
vapours which increase the mystic character of their power. Still
she contrived to get intoxicated; and, so vain had been his efforts
to trace the source of the evil, that he verily believed the imp was
possessed of some charm whereby she realized a compact with the enemy
of mankind. If he went out to stalk round the house and brood over
his misfortunes, he found that she had, in the meantime, got herself
made perfect in insensibility; and if she, by any means, got to a
short distance from the house unobserved, she returned in a condition
no less lamentable. It was a big, crying evil, fronted with shame,
and adminicled with devilries of every degree and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> colour that ever
came from the box of Pandora. It was impossible that man could stand
it; and necessity, the mother of invention, stung the obtuse brain
of Gustavus to something like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenium perfervidum</i> of genius
itself. He knew very well that he had terrified men; and, indeed, as
love is said to be inspired by a look, so one glance of him was, of
a surety, sufficient to have produced fear in any one but Julia, who
valued his fierce looks no more than if they had been smiles. But he
could do more than look&mdash;he could threaten; and the question that
troubled him, for a time, was, what he should threaten; for he had made
up his mind to terrify her in some way; and the sheer necessity of
projecting something worthy of himself, was the parent of one of the
most extraordinary expedients that ever came from the brain of genius.</p>

<p>The expedient was this: He told her, with a big oath, and a face
at which the walls of St Sebastian might have trembled to their
foundations, that, the first time he found her intoxicated, he would
put her in a coffin, and actually bury her in the earth, as deep and
sure as ever Jonah was buried in the belly of the biggest monster of
the deep. Nor was the threat a sheer gust of breath, for he immediately
set about making a real coffin&mdash;a performance which he executed very
well, painting it as black as fashion requires, and studding it with
a goodly portion of white buttons, which he tore from a mass of old
regimentals; and, having finished it, he placed it in his bedroom,
as a grim indication of the reality of his intentions. But the woman
who could defy the terrors of such a face as that of Gustavus M’Iver,
had nothing to fear from the sight of a coffin; and so, of a surety,
it turned out&mdash;for the determined baggage not only laughed broad in
his countenance, but told him to it, that, so long as he was cowardly
enough to have any fear of the gallows, she had not a jot of reason to
be afraid of being buried alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Both parties, in this way, seemed equally determined. Gustavus took
his usual mighty strides along the room, and set the pulleys of his
facial muscles in rapid play; and Julia, the pert minx, indulged in her
laughing mockery, that seemed to set him and his coffin at defiance.
That she was as serious as Socrates in her disbelief of his intentions,
was very soon made manifest&mdash;for the coffin had not been three days
old, when she got as drunk as Midas; and that he was apparently as
determined as Draed, he very soon gave suitable demonstrations&mdash;for,
in place of lifting her into bed according to his usual practice, he
placed her into the grim chest, and, putting a mattock on the top of
it, he hoisted it on his shoulders, and strode away forth to a wood as
dark as the recesses of the Cumæan witch, that stood at some distance
from his habitation. There, as good fortune would have it, he found,
already dug to his hand, a deep hole, round the edges of which grew a
profusion of bushes and furze, sufficient to make the pit as grim and
frightful as the very grave itself; and there, having deposited his
charge, with plenty of room for breath through the holes he had made in
the lid, he turned him round, and stalked away home to cook his dinner.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>JULIA GETS INTO A PLEASANT PANDEMONIUM.</small></h3>

<p>Now, it happened that honest Angus M’Guire and Donald M’Nair, two
brawny Highlanders, were that day busily occupied in distilling a
drop of good whisky, in a subterraneous distillery, to which the hole
wherein Gustavus had laid his wife, led by a covered and concealed
passage; and it was in no other than this very place that Julia had
been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> so plentifully supplied with the liquor by which she was so often
inebriated. Sitting by the mouth of the worm or serpent, which gave
forth drop by drop the poison, stronger and more hurtful than ever came
from the mouth of the Snake of Lerna, they heard a strange noise on the
ground over their heads, as Gustavus was busy about the details of his
interment, and shook with unfeigned terror, as if they had been on the
point of being discovered in their illicit operations. By and by they
heard a rumbling in the mouth of the cavern, as if some one had been
in the act of descending, and, rising and seizing each a pistol and a
sword, they stood on the defensive, prepared to slay the first gauger
that should set his face into their subterraneous dominions. But the
never an exciseman appeared: in place of that, to them, most fearful of
all mortal beings, they saw the identical coffin in which Julia M’Iver
had been laid, fall with a heavy sound upon the floor of their dark
habitation.</p>

<p>Terror-struck, twenty times more than if they had seen the ghost of a
murdered exciseman, they stood with their hair forcing up their bonnets
on their head, and stared till their eyes seemed ready to burst from
the sockets, at the dreadful object of their fears. A faint light
glimmered through the cave, and was reflected from the rows of white
buttons with which the black vision was studded; and all the horrid
features of the grim apparition were displayed by that kind of dim
light by which they could be seen to advantage. They could speak not
a word to each other; and their mutual looks excited by sympathy a
greater mutual fear than ever; and so they still stood and looked, and
wondered, and would have moved their bodies to take a closer survey,
but could not for very nervousness&mdash;albeit any one of them would have
knocked a gauger on the head in an instant. But it was clear, even
to themselves, that they could not thus stand staring at a coffin
for ever; and it is not unlikely that this prospective impossibility
supplied the place of courage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> and so, Donald being the less timid of
the two, gradually approached and surveyed their extraordinary visiter.
Beckoning his friend Angus forward, he proceeded to force open the lid.</p>

<p>“The corpse o’ Julia M’Iver, our goot customer,” said he, “as sure as
my name’s Tonald M’Nair!” And Angus, bending his head down, and holding
his hands up, acknowledged the apparent truth. “Murtered py Custaphus,
py Cot!” added he, “and puried here to hide the plack, purning shame!”</p>

<p>And they sat down by the coffin, and stared at each other and at the
dead beauty, lost in deep cogitation as to what they should do. Their
thoughts both took the same direction.</p>

<p>“What is to pe done?” muttered they both at the same instant.</p>

<p>“We cannot inform, and we cannot take the pody to Custaphus,” again
said Donald; “for that would tiscover us.”</p>

<p>“To pe surely na,” said Angus; “put we can pury her, cannot we, Tonald?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that we can,” answered the latter; “and that we will, too, as
surely as my grandmother was puried in the houf o’ Kepplemechan.”</p>

<p>“Ay, or as mine was puried in Fochapers kirkyard,” rejoined Angus; “but
we maun let the nicht fa’ first, or it may pe said that we were the
murterers o’ the puir cratur. Ochone! put this is a tam pad world. We
maun hae a quaich to keep up oor courage.”</p>

<p>And so they set about preparing themselves for the work they had in
prospect, by drinking of their own spirits by the side of the coffin;
every now and then looking in the face of Julia, and lamenting the
unhappy fate of their former visiter, with whom they had drunk many a
good bumper, and enjoyed much good fun and frolic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In this occupation, and exchanging many a comely sentiment on the
wickedness of man, and the shortness and uncertainty of human life,
they passed several hours, until it should be dark enough for the
purpose of interring Julia in reality, which they would execute as
surely as ever mortal was consigned to dust. They had drunk till their
eyes began to reel in their heads, and till tears of mawkish and
drunken sentimentality were dropping on the face of their merry boon
companion, as she lay in her bier. A toast of exquisite pathos&mdash;“Here’s
to the good cratur’s soul then!” had just escaped from Donald’s lips,
when Julia opened her eyes, and, altogether unconscious where she lay,
obeyed the first impulse of her wakening heart, by holding out her
hand, and asking for a glass of the whisky which she saw them drinking
with so much good will. Twenty ghosts in their winding sheets could not
have produced a greater sensation; for the two Highlanders threw from
them their quaichs, and, starting to their feet, flew, with a scream of
terror that might have been heard upon the surface of the earth itself,
into the farthest recesses of the dark abode.</p>

<p>“Heaven pe merciful to us!” they both muttered, as they crouched down
beside the stove, and eyed fearfully the moving corpse, through the
dim light that came from the half-concealed fire; and their fears had
a small chance of being removed or alleviated by what they farther
heard and saw; for, as they watched and trembled, they witnessed the
rising terrors of Julia herself, who, looking around her, and seeing
herself placed in the coffin, had never a shadow of doubt that she
was actually buried, and that she was in the region appointed for the
wicked daughters of men. She began to groan piteously; and, being yet
only half sober, mixed up her thoughts of the lower regions with the
feelings she cherished on earth, in such a grotesque manner, that it
would have been impossible for an ordinary person to have heard her
without at once trembling and laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“And am I, of a surety, here at the long run,” she muttered, “among
devils and devils’ dams, who will have never a qualm of mercy for me
any more than they have for their other victims, who have broken the
laws of the upper world?” And, sighing as deep as her stomach, she
paused and again soliloquised:&mdash;“But did I not see my good friends,
Angus M’Guire and Donald M’Nair, drinking by my side, even at this
moment? There cannot be a doubt on’t, and they will be dead and damned
too for a certainty; but, faith, I care not if I should be here after
all, if I fare as they were faring even now, when I saw them with the
quaichs in their very hands, as I have seen before in the distillery in
the wood of Balmaclallan, so often when I was in the body. Ho! there!
Donald M’Nair, it is no other than Julia Briggs that calls you, and she
is as thirsty as fire can make her.”</p>

<p>The truth now began to dawn on the minds of the Highlanders. “She is
no more tead than I am, or any living pody,” cried Donald, as he began
to move from his dark hole. “I am coming, my tarling Julia; and, py
te Holy Virgin, you shall not want what ye are now asking for!” And,
pulling Angus along with him, he again approached the coffin, where he
saw his old friend looking up from her prostrate position with a pair
of as clear eyes as whisky ever illuminated. “Are ye tead or living,
Julia?” cried Angus.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you till I get a quaich,” answered Julia; and the
medicine was on the instant administered by Donald, when all doubt on
the mysterious subject having been dispelled, her friends lifted her
from the coffin, and they set to work after their usual manner, which
was no other than indulging in numerous potations. The recollection
of Gustavus’s threat enabled her to explain everything; and as they
sat carousing and singing in great glee, they laughed heartily at the
circumstance of Gustavus having buried his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> wife in a distillery, with
the view of curing her of a love of whisky.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>GUSTAVUS GETS INTO TROUBLE AND OUT OF IT.</small></h3>


<p>While they were thus as happy as drink and frolic could make any of
the sons or daughters of Adam, Gustavus was meditating on the probable
effects of his extraordinary remedy for drunkenness, and enjoying
already the triumph he anticipated, as the fruits of his ingenuity.
He had cooked for himself a good dinner, and, being thus also in good
spirits, he counted the hours as they passed, every moment of which
was worth to him a grain of gold, in so far as they would purchase a
relief from the thraldom and misery in which he had been so long held.
He had given her four hours of the grave, and the increasing length
of his stride seemed to indicate that he was fast approaching some
resolution, which was probably to go and see how his Julia was faring
in her dark habitation. He had left the ropes by which she had been
let down, in such a position that he could draw her out again with the
greatest certainty, so that he was perfectly at ease on the score of
her ultimate safety; but all his efforts, he knew, would be worse than
endeavouring to make iron swim, to hold an eel by the tail, to dissect
cheese mites, or make a cod warble, or any other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opera inanis</i>, if
she were taken out before she awoke and experienced all the terrors
of her situation. He therefore gave her an hour or two more, and then
sallied forth as grim as Hercules when he went a bull-baiting, to
reconnoitre, and ascertain if any indications of her being awake came
from the grave (as he expected it would be) of her bad habits and the
womb of her regeneration. A very few movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> of his immense limbs
brought him to the spot; but not an inch of the rope he could find;
and, though he pulled aside the bushes, and stared with goggle eyes
into the pit, not a glimpse of the coffin could he discover. The affair
was marvellous and unfathomable as the wells of Agamemnon; and he stood
and stared with mute wonder, at what appeared to be nothing else in
the world than bewitched devilry. He looked around him to see if he
could find any traces of either the coffin or Julia Briggs; but all was
still and hazy, and nothing could he see or hear; so he tried the pit
again, and, to search the bottom of it, he took a long stick from a
neighbouring tree, and plunged it in, and groped, and sounded; but it
was clear that he never struck on wood, nor indeed upon anything but
the soft brush stuff with which the Highlanders had again closed up the
aperture. He even descended into the hole, as far as he could reach his
limbs, while he held on by the bushy side; and he thus ascertained to
a dead certainty that the never a bit of a coffin was there, or indeed
anything but furze, among which his feet became entangled. Having got
out again with difficulty, he fell to roaring and shouting&mdash;“Julia
M’Iver! Julia M’Iver!” But no answer was returned, save by the echoing
wood, which mocked him like the American bird of many voices that
laughs at the eloquence of man. No other conclusion could he come to,
but that Julia, coffin and all, had been carried off by the prime
minister of Oberon, or some other power, that had determined to punish
her for her intemperance, or him for his cruelty; and his former love
returning, now that he had, perhaps for ever, lost the object of it,
he grew frantic as the lover of Briseis, and stamped and strode about
the wood, accusing himself as the murderer of his wife, and trembling
for his neck, which he had put in a position of jeopardy. To add to his
terrors, he sometimes thought he heard strange shouts of mirth, coming
from under the ground; and his mind still straying to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> land of the
court of the pigmy king, he fancied that the thieves were rejoicing in
their subterranean abodes, over the triumph they had achieved over a
mortal creature. The strength or weakness of superstition has nothing
to do with the size of the bones, or the strength of thews and sinews
of the individuals over whom it exercises its control; and there was
no marvel at all that Gustavus felt undefined terrors laying hold of
him, as the darkness of the night increased, and the blackness of
the mystery enveloped his brain. He had faced cannon in his day, and
hewn down warriors as gigantic as himself without a qualm; but that
was no reason why he should not quail before the powers of infernal
or subterranean agency; and so to be sure it was well proved by what
followed; for he marched home as if he had been on a retreat, with,
perhaps, more ideas in his head than ever could have been supposed
to find an entry into the impenetrable fortress which, in spite of
rockets, he had so long carried on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He passed the night in pacing his apartment, expecting every moment
that Julia, who was occupied according to her heart’s desire, would
return to her home&mdash;but no Julia came; and in the morning he was
saluted by the carrier, who asked him, with a knowing look, what had
become of Mrs M’Iver, and to what use he had applied the coffin he
(the carrier) had seen through the window when he last passed the
house. Gustavus stared at him in amazement, without deigning one word
of reply; but, the man being gone, he saw, with as much light as his
brain was capable of reflecting, something like a foundation for a
charge of murder against him, in the event of his wife not making her
appearance. This conclusion wound up the evils that he had entailed
upon himself by entering into the fearful state of matrimony; and there
can be little doubt that, if he had known the Greek of the woman-hater,
Simonides, of which of course he knew never a syllable, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thundered forth the whole epithets of his poem in a voice of thunder.
Another day passed, and no Julia was yet to be seen; and on the second
day, straggling individuals began to pry about the house, just as if a
murder had been committed there, and they were looking for blood-spots.
He grew every moment more terrified, was unable to cook, or even to
eat, and roamed about with the muscles of his face hanging over the
maxillary bones like flaps of leather, and sunken eyes that seemed to
look inwards, where there was in fact nothing to be seen worth looking
at. Every step frightened him, and every sound startled him, from
reveries of trials and interrogations, and hanging and dissecting;
for he looked every hour for a visit from the authorities. He had
sense enough to see that everything was against him&mdash;the disappearance
of Julia&mdash;their endless quarrels&mdash;the coffin&mdash;all arrayed against a
drivelling, idiot statement about trying to wean his wife from the
quaich by pretending to bury her alive.</p>

<p>Things were fast progressing to being just as bad as there is any
occasion for them to be when a sinful man is the victim; for, some
time afterwards, the mother of Julia herself, with two friends from
the Canongate, came to see the married pair. Now, Gustavus saw them
at a long distance, and, knowing that he could not account for his
wife, he resolved upon sneaking away into the woods, after locking the
door; and this accordingly he did in double quick time; but he had
not got far away, when, upon turning to look behind him, he saw the
carrier again returning, and very soon stop at his door, and enter into
conversation with the three women. He watched all their motions, and it
was apparent to him that the very affair of the murder they supposed he
had committed was alone the subject of their conversation.</p>

<p>Nay, he saw them begin to try to force open the door and able to
contain himself no longer, he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall Gustavus M’Iver, who has killed a dozen of Frenchmen in one day,
be afraid of three women? The never will he, by Saint Sebastian!”</p>

<p>So he went back to the house; and when the three women and the carrier
saw him coming out of the planting, they set up such a loud scream as
had never been heard in these woods since the reign of the wolves, and
ran up to him, crying out, that he was a base and a bloody murderer,
and demanding to see the body of the sacrificed Julia, who, as her
mother ejaculated, was never intended by nature to be the wife of such
a fearful ogre.</p>

<p>“Give me the body of my daughter,” she said, “dead or alive. Where is
the coffin that the carrier saw standing in the house? It is gone, and
Julia is in it&mdash;buried, no doubt, in some hole of the woods. Why will
you not speak, Gustavus M’Iver?”</p>

<p>Now, the very best reason on earth could be assigned for Gustavus
saying nothing&mdash;and that was, that he had of a real truth nothing in
the wide extent of his brain to say, that any one in the world, far
less the mother of his wife, would believe for one instant of time. So
he stood and rolled over the three women his large eyes, just, as the
mother said, as if he would have eaten them all three, as she suspected
he had done her daughter; but the never a vocable escaped from his lips.</p>

<p>“Why will you not speak, Gustavus?” cried the mother.</p>

<p>“Why will you not speak, man?” cried another of the women.</p>

<p>“Why will you not speak?” cried they all together in one question, so
loud that no question since the time when all the Barons of England
asked, in one cry, King John to give them their rights, had ever
exceeded it in intensity and vociferation.</p>

<p>But it was clear this could last no longer than the patience of the
women; and every one knows that the time comprehended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> by the longevity
of that feminine virtue, is not so long as the life of Methuselah; so,
in a minute, they fell on him with their nails, and rugged his hair,
and scratched his face, and pulled him to the earth, and trampled upon
him, till he who had fought in the Peninsula began to think that it
was time for him to call up his old courage, and fight once again in
his advanced years. So, rising up, he placed himself in an attitude
which he knew had produced terrible effects in former times; and, to be
sure, so it might, for he gnashed his teeth, and held out his yard-long
arms, and rolled his eyes in such a manner, yet saying not a word all
the while, that the women got alarmed, and cried to the carrier to
assist them; but the man was off the moment he saw there was a chance
of battle. So the women gave in, and began to try the soothing system
with him&mdash;an effort in which they were as successful as their sex ever
is when a man is to be humbugged; and Gustavus was on the instant
mollified into softness, and even lugubrious sentimentality.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>AN APPARITION.</small></h3>

<p>There was a pause, after which Gustavus, offering two of the women an
arm each, leaving the other to bring up the rear, he began a solemn
march to the scene of his grief&mdash;the mysterious spot, where he threw
down his long, lank body upon the ground, and muttered his sorrows
between his lubber lips, in accents that would have put to flight the
ugliest satyr that ever sported in a wood. He took up his station close
by the mouth of the deceptive grave, to mitigate his sorrow and fear by
a little sentiment&mdash;a coarse commodity, that might have made another
laugh, but sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> to make him weep. That day he might be in prison
and ruined for ever; and, as for Julia M’Iver, he would never see her
again. “She has been in this hole three days,” said he, pointing to the
grave.</p>

<p>“Ochone! ochone!” roared the three women, crying bitterly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his heavy eye was fixed on the ground; he heard a noise,
and, looking up, what on earth should he see but the head of Julia
herself above the ground, and all the rest of her body below it? She
leered at him and the women knowingly, and laughed till the woods
rang; and, rising up out of the very hole where she had been interred,
she ran, or rather staggered to him&mdash;for she was fresh from the
still&mdash;flung herself around his neck, and hugged him with a grasp
of embrace that many a husband would give a hundred pounds for any
day. Nor was Gustavus insensible to its efficacy; for he returned the
embrace, and even cried and blubbered like (as all sentimental writers
say when they wish to express great sensibility&mdash;that is, babyism) a
child&mdash;and a very pretty child to be sure he was. We cannot tell how
long the embrace lasted. Everything in nature has been measured but
love embraces. Writers are chary on the subject; and very knowingly,
too, because they know that it is what is called “a kittle point;” but
we have no such qualms, and so boldly assert, that Mr and Mrs M’Iver’s
embrace lasted at least three minutes.</p>

<p>This new apparition transcended all they had yet seen or experienced;
for how she could have lain three days and nights in the cold earth,
and risen on the fourth as drunk as she was when she was interred,
puzzled them beyond any conjuration they had ever heard of. But
Gustavus was glad to see her on any condition, and took her straight
home, to get an account from her, when she was sober of all the wonders
she had seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> bowels of the earth; where, in the midst of Hop
and Mop, Pip and Trip, Fib and Tib, and Jill and Jin, and all the other
imps of Mab’s court, she had doubtless been since the day on which
she was let down into the pit. Whether he or the women ever got this
information or not, we cannot say; but it is certain that he attempted
no further cure of Julia’s irregular habits, contenting himself with
the evil lot of a bad wife, which is, perhaps, the only one on earth
that it is utterly impossible to get quit of by any other means than
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE FIRST AND SECOND MARRIAGE.</h2>


<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said a venerable-looking, white-headed man,
accosting me one day, about six weeks ago, as I was walking alone near
the banks of the Whitadder; “ye are one of the authors of the ‘Border
Tales’, sir&mdash;are ye not?”</p>

<p>Not being aware of anything in the “Tales of the Borders” of which I
need to be ashamed, and moreover being accustomed to meet with such
salutations, after glancing at the stranger, with the intention, I
believe, of taking the measure of his mind, or scrutinizing his motive
in asking the question, I answered&mdash;“I am, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir,” said he, “I can tell ye a true story, and one that
happened upon the Borders here within my recollection, and which was
also within my own knowledge, which I think would make a capital tale.”</p>

<p>Now, I always rejoice in hearing any tale or legend from the lips of a
grey-haired chronicler. I do not recollect the period when I did not
take an interest in such things; and a tradition of the olden time, or
a tale that pictured human nature as it is, ever made the unceasing
birr, birring of the spinning-wheel&mdash;which the foot, belike, of an aged
widow kept in perpetual motion&mdash;as agreeable to me as the choicest
music. For, what is tradition, but the fragments which History left or
lost in its progress to eternity; and which Poetry, following in its
wake, gathered up as treasures too precious to be overwhelmed by the
approaching waves of oblivion, and, breathing upon them the influence
of its own immortal spirit, embalmed them in the hearts and in the
memories of men unto all generations? Though, therefore, it was no
ancient legend which the stranger had to relate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> yet, knowing that it
might not on that account be the less interesting, I thanked him, “and
with greedy ears devoured up his discourse.”</p>

<p>The story which he then related to me, I shall, therefore, after him,
communicate to my readers.</p>

<p>You will excuse me in not mentioning the name of the town in which the
chief incidents mentioned in our story occurred. There may be some yet
living to whom some of them might not be agreeable. I shall, therefore,
speak of it as the town of H&mdash;&mdash;, and other circumstances referred to
may lead you to form an idea of “its whereabouts.”</p>

<p>Many years have passed&mdash;at least forty&mdash;since the period at which our
story commences; and there then dwelt in the town of H&mdash;&mdash; one Walter
Kerr. (So you will allow me to call him.) His parents were what are
generally called respectable sort of people; for the house in which
they dwelt was their own, and there were also three or four others, all
very good and respectable-looking houses (as we say again), the rents
of which they received from their tenants. But there is no word in our
language to which less respect is shewn than the word respectability.
It is prostituted every day. Is is no matter whether a man be the
proprietor of one house, one acre, one pound, or a hundred houses, a
thousand acres, and ten thousand pounds; neither houses, acres, nor
money can make him truly respectable. As the sun, moon, and stars shed
light upon the earth, so do honesty, virtue, and strict integrity
confer respectability on the head of their possessor. I care not what
a man’s situation in life may be, nor whether he be a hewer of wood
or a drawer of water, the lord of a forest, or one who hath a fleet
upon the seas; shew me a good, a virtuous, and an upright man&mdash;and
there is a respectable man, be his rank or situation in life what it
may. The parents of Walter Kerr, however, were respectable in a better
and a truer sense of the term than that of being merely persons of a
certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> property; they were Christians not only in their profession
but in their practice. Walter was by far the cleverest of the family;
and from his boyhood his parents designed him for the pulpit, and gave
him an education accordingly. Like many parents, they thought that his
cleverness was a sufficient reason why they should bring him up to the
sacred profession, without once considering how far the seriousness of
his thoughts and habits fitted him for preparing for the office. It
must be acknowledged, however, that in this they were not singular. We
find hundreds who, without perceiving either cleverness or piety in
their favourite son, resolve to make him a minister. Yea, frequently,
from his very cradle his calling is determined. I remember having heard
a good woman say&mdash;“If I live to have another son, and he be spared to
me, I shall bring him up for the kirk!”</p>

<p>But the parents of Walter Kerr were possessed of more discretion; and
when they found that he was averse to their proposal of his becoming
a preacher, they abandoned the idea, though not without reluctance,
and some tears on the part of his mother. Now, Walter was a youth of
a gentle temper and an affectionate heart; but, at the same time,
he seemed formed for being what you would term a man of business.
He was shrewd, active, speculative, and calculating, with quite a
sufficient degree of caution, as ballast, to regulate his more ardent
propensities. At his own request, he was bound apprentice to a general
merchant in his native town; and before he was twenty-one years of age,
he commenced business for himself. He began with but a small stock in
trade; for his parents could not afford a great deal to set him up. Yet
he was attentive to business; he pushed it, and his trade increased,
and his stock became more various. He had scarcely, however, been two
years in business, when he took unto himself a portionless wife. His
parents were displeased&mdash;they looked upon him as lost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> Every one said
that he had done a foolish thing, and agreed that it was madness in
him to marry, at least so hastily, and before he could say that even
the goods in his shop were his own. But people are very apt to talk a
great deal of nonsense upon this subject. The important question is not
<em>when</em> a man marries, but <em>who</em> he marries. They talk of a wife tying
up his hands, and placing a barrier before his prospects; in short, as
bringing a blight over his worldly expectations, like an untimely frost
nipping and withering an opening bud. Now all this is mere twaddle&mdash;a
shewing off of self-wisdom, to make known how much more wisely we
have or would have acted than the person referred to. It is one of
the thousand popular fallacies which ever float on the surface of the
chit-chat of society. A married man, young or old, is always a more
sponsible sort of character than a bachelor. If a man take unto himself
an amiable and a prudent wife, even though she bring him not a shilling
as a dowry, and although he may be young in years and a beginner in
business, he doeth well. Had he doubled his stock, his credit and his
custom, he would not have done better; for he has a double motive to do
so. He has found one to beguile his dulness, to soothe care, to cheer
him forward, and to stimulate him to exertion; and that, too, tenderly
as the breath of May fanneth and kisseth the young leaves and flowers
into life and beauty. But all this dependeth, as hath been said, upon
her amiableness and prudence; for, if the wife whom a man taketh for
“better for worse,” possess not these indispensable requisites, he
weddeth a living sorrow, he nurseth an adder in his bosom, he giveth
his right hand to ruin.</p>

<p>Now, the wife of Walter Kerr possessed those qualities which rendereth
a virtuous woman as a crown of glory to her husband. She was the
daughter of a decayed farmer, and her name was Hannah Jerdan. To
her the misfortunes of her parents were not such; for, while they
had made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> a stranger to luxury, they had introduced her to the
acquaintanceship of frugality and industry. At the time she gave her
hand to Walter Kerr, she was scarce twenty; and to have looked on her,
you would have thought of some fair and lovely flower which sought the
sequestered dale or the shaded glen, where its beauties might blush
unseen&mdash;young, modest, meek, affectionate, and beautiful, man never led
a lovelier bride to the altar. Her husband soon found that whatever the
world might think or say of the step he had taken, he had done well and
wisely. She not only became his assistant in his business, and one who
took much care and anxiety from his mind, but her affection fell upon
his bosom like the shadow of an angel’s wing, that was spread over him
to guard him from evil; and he found her, too, as a monitor whispering
truth in the accents of love. If he acquired money in trade, she taught
him how to keep it and profit by it&mdash;and that is a “secret worth
knowing.” Let it not be supposed that she was one of those miserly
beings who scrape farthings together for the sake of hoarding them. In
her spirit, meanness had no place; but there were two proverbs which
she never suffered herself to forget, or those around her to neglect,
and those were, that “a penny saved is a penny gained,” and “wilful
waste makes woful want.” Nor do I wonder that the latter saying took
deep root in her heart; for, as having experienced privation in the
days of her father’s distress, there is nothing can be more painful
to those who have known and felt what want is, than to see food, for
want of which they were once ready to perish, wasted, and that, too,
perchance, while a hunger-stricken beggar has been turned rudely from
the door while he prayed for a morsel to eat. She would not see the
crumbs which fell from the table wasted. In this her husband readily
perceived the propriety of her conduct, and he esteemed her the more as
he witnessed it; but the force of her first adage, that “a penny saved
is a penny gained,” he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> slow to appreciate in its true light. Yet
for this, perhaps, there was a reason. Previous to his marriage, he had
been in the habit of spending the evening after business hours, with
a club of young tradesmen and other acquaintances. Now, habit is the
pettiest and the most imperious of all tyrants. Even with a pinch of
snuff it can make you its slave. It renders you miserable, until you
once more bend the knee before it. But, as I have said, habit, though
an imperious, is a petty tyrant; and three weeks’ resolution, though
you will have struggles to encounter, will enable you to snap asunder
the strongest chain that ever habit forged. I do not mean the habits,
the seeds of which we acquire in infancy, and which grow with our
growth and strengthen with our strength, and which, in fact, perform a
part of our education (though we do not admit it), until they are set
down as things belonging to or ingrafted in our natures; but I mean the
habits which we acquire in after-life. And, as has been stated, Walter
Kerr had acquired a habit of attending an evening club, of which he had
been a member during the last year of his apprenticeship; and, from the
period that he commenced business up to his marriage, and a few days
after he had brought home his wife, he attended the club as usual. He
was happy in the society of his young and fair wife; but still (as we
say in the north), there was a “craiking” within him for something to
make him perfectly happy, and that “craiking” was to attend the club as
usual. Now, it was not a club in which they either drank deep or sat
late&mdash;for it was a regulation amongst them that no man should sit in
the club-room after ten o’clock, or drink more than three glasses; but,
although they had this wholesome regulation, they had no by-law against
what many of them called “<em>adjournments</em>,” or “<em>sederunts</em>,” and at
which, though out of the club-room, the three glasses frequently became
six.</p>

<p>With regard to the “sederunts,” however, Hannah had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> no cause to
complain of her husband; for he never had been one of those who formed
them. Neither did she murmur, or consider herself neglected, on account
of his attending the club; for she reasoned with herself, that, after
the cares, toils, and business of the day, he required some relaxation;
and although her company might be more agreeable to him than any other,
yet she knew that the beauty and the fragrance of a flower does not
increase by for ever looking upon it, and on it only, but that our
admiration of the flower increases, as we pass over the weeds which we
behold around us. Yet, she thought that every night was too much&mdash;more
than relaxation required; and she thought, also, that a shilling
a-night was six shillings in the week (for let it not be thought that
a club, of which Walter Kerr was a member, met on the Sabbath), and
that six shillings a-week was nearly sixteen pounds in the year&mdash;a
sum that might frequently be of use when accounts became due, and
money was difficult to get in. She therefore delicately and tenderly
endeavoured to break her husband from the habit he had acquired; but
she attempted it in vain. He believed himself to be one of the most
frugal and industrious tradesmen in the town; and nothing but bringing
the fact plainly and broadly before him, seemed sufficient to convince
him that there was aught of expensiveness in his habits. But his wife,
more delicately and efficiently, did so convince him. They were talking
together of many things, and their conversation lent wings to the short
hours, when, an opportunity offering, she related to him an anecdote,
which brought home to himself his nightly attendance at the club; and,
as I know the story to be no allegory, nor child of the brain, but a
fact, I shall relate it to you.</p>

<p>“In a town,” said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> “not many miles south of the Border, there
dwelt a man who was by trade a mechanic, and who was the father of
seven children. For sixteen years he had never wanted employment (when
he chose to work), and his earnings averaged from five-and-thirty
shillings to two pounds a-week. But, with a number of associates, he
was in the habit of attending, daily and nightly, what they termed
their house of call. In the morning, as he went to his labour, he could
not pass it without having what he called his ‘<em>nipper</em>,’ or what some
of the good people in Scotland call their ‘<em>morning</em>,’ which, being
interpreted, meaneth a glass of gin, rum, or whisky.” (For gentle as
Hannah was, there was a sprinkling of the wag in her character.) “At
mid-day,” she added, “he had to give it another call; and to pass it on
returning from his work at night was out of the question. Sometimes,
and not unfrequently, when he called in for his ‘nipper’ in the
morning, he sat down&mdash;in a room which had two windows, looking east and
west&mdash;and forgot to rise until, after he had seen from the one window
the sun rising, he beheld it set from the other. But it was the force
of habit&mdash;it had grown in upon him, as he said; and what could the
poor man do? He beheld his wife broken-hearted, going almost in rags,
and their affection had changed into bickerings and reproaches. His
children, too, were half-starved, ill-clad, and unschooled; and for
what education they got, he thought not of paying the schoolmaster&mdash;he
felt nothing in hand for his money, and therefore could not see the
force of the debt. But the poor man could not help it. It was true he
earned about two pounds a-week, but which way the money went he could
not tell. He did not, as he thought, deserve the reproaches of his
wife. His ‘morning’ was only fourpence, his call at mid-day the same,
and his evening pipe and glass a shilling or eighteenpence&mdash;that, he
thought, was nothing, for a man working so hard as he did; and when he
did take a day now and then, he said that was not worth reckoning, for
his clay could not keep together without moisture; and as for the glass
or two which he took on a Sunday, why, they were not worth mentioning.
Thus he could see no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> cause for the unhappiness of his wife, the
poverty of his house, and the half-nakedness of his family. He had
to ‘do as other people did, or he might leave their society;’ and he
attributed all to bad management somewhere, but not on his part. But
one Sunday morning he had lingered in their house of call longer than
his companions, and he was sitting there when the churchwardens and
parish-officers went their rounds, and came to the house. To conceal
him from them there, and avoid the penalty&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Tom,’ said the landlady, ‘here the wardens a-comin’. If they find
thee here, lad, or meet thee goin’ out, thou wilt be fined, and me too;
and it may give my hoose a bad name. Coom up stairs, and I will shew
thee through the hoose, while they examine the tap and the parlour.’</p>

<p>“So saying, Tom the mechanic followed the hostess from room to room,
wondering at what he saw; for the furniture, as he said to himself,
was like a nobleman’s, and he marvelled how such things could be; and
while he did so, he contrasted the splendour he beheld around him with
the poverty and wretchedness of his own garret. And, after shewing
him through several rooms, she at last, with a look of importance,
ushered him into what she called <em>the drawing-room</em>&mdash;but, now-a-days,
drawing-rooms have become as common as gooseberries, and every house
with three rooms and a kitchen has one. Poor Tom the mechanic was
amazed as he beheld the richly-coloured and fancy-figured carpet; he
was afraid to tread on it&mdash;and, indeed, he was told to clean his feet
well before he did so. But he was more astonished when he beheld a
splendid mirror, with a brightly gilded and carved frame, which reached
almost from the ceiling to the floor, and in which he beheld his
person, covered with his worn-out and un-holiday-like habiliments, from
top to toe, though they were his only suit. Yet more was he amazed,
when the ostentatious mistress of the house, opening what appeared to
him a door in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> wall, displayed to him rows of shining silver plate.
Ha raised his eyes, he lifted up his hands&mdash;‘Lack! Ma’am!’ says he,
‘how d’ye get all these mighty fine things?’</p>

<p>“And the landlady, laughing at his simplicity, said&mdash;‘Why, lad, by
fools’ pennies to be sure.’</p>

<p>“But the words ‘fools’ pennies’ touched his heart as if a sharp
instrument had pierced it; and he thought unto himself, ‘I am one of
those fools;’ and he turned away and left the house with the words
written upon his conscience; and, as he went, he made a vow unto
himself that, until that day twelve months, he would neither enter the
house he had left, nor any other house of a similar description&mdash;but
that on that day twelve months he would visit it again. When he went
home, his wife was surprised at his homecoming; for it was seldom he
returned during the day. He had two shillings left; and taking them
from his pocket, he gave them to one of his daughters, desiring her
to go out and purchase a quartern loaf and a quantity of tea, sugar,
and butter. His wife was silent from wonder. He took her hand and
said&mdash;‘Why, thou seemest to wonder at me, old lass; but I tell thee
what&mdash;I have had a lesson this mornin’ that I shan’t forget; and when
thou findest me throwing away even a penny again, I will give thee
liberty to call me by any name thou likes.’</p>

<p>“His wife was astonished, and his family were astonished; and in the
afternoon he took down the neglected and dust-covered Bible, and read a
chapter aloud&mdash;though certainly not from any correct religious feeling.
But he had made the resolution to reform, and he had learned enough
to know that reading his Bible was a necessary and excellent helper
towards the accomplishment of his purpose. It was the happiest Sabbath
his family had ever spent; and his wife said that, even on her wedding
Sunday, she was not half so happy.</p>

<p>“But, the day twelve months from that on which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> seen the
splendid furniture, the rich, carpet, the gorgeous mirror, and the
costly plate, arrived. It was a summer morning, and he requested his
wife and children to dress before seven o’clock. During the last twelve
months, his wife and his children had found it a pleasure to obey him,
and they did so readily. He took the arm of his wife in his, and each
of them led a younger child by the hand, while the elder walked hand
in hand before them; and they went on until they came unto his former
house of call; and standing opposite it, he said unto his wife&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Now, old woman, thou and the little ones will go in here with me for
five minutes, and thou shalt see something that will please thee.’</p>

<p>“So they went into the house together, and Tom the mechanic found
his old associates seated around the room as he was wont to see them
twelve months before, just as though they had been fixtures belonging
to the establishment: and as he, with his wife and children, entered,
his former companions rose, and exclaimed in wonder&mdash;‘Ha! Thomas! what
wind has blown thee here?’ For, though they called him merely <em>Tom</em>
before, he had <em>Thomas</em> from them now. And, as the landlady entered and
saw a well-dressed man and woman, with seven clean and well-dressed
children around them, in her tap-room, she wondered exceedingly; for
their appearance contrasted strangely with that of her other customers
amongst whom they were seated.</p>

<p>“‘Why, don’t you know me, Ma’am?’ inquired Thomas, observing her look
of curiosity and wonderment.</p>

<p>“‘Why, I can hardly say as how I do, sir,’ she replied; ‘and yet I am
sure I have seen you somewhere.’</p>

<p>“‘That you have, Ma’am,’ answered he; ‘I am your old customer, Tom
Such-an-one.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Lack me! is it possible!&mdash;and so you are! Why, what a change there
is upon thee! thou art quite a gentleman turned. And is this lady thy
wife, and these thy children? Well, now! how smart you have them all!
How in the world do you manage it?’</p>

<p>“‘O Ma’am,’ said Tom the mechanic, ‘nothing in the world is more
easy&mdash;the <em>fools’ pennies</em> which I before gave to buy your fine
carpets, your mirror, and your silver plate, <em>I now keep in my own
pocket</em>.’ So saying, he bowed to her, and wishing her good morning,
with his wife’s arm in his, they and their children left the house
and returned home. Such,” added Hannah, “is the true story of Tom the
mechanic.”</p>

<p>The anecdote told upon her husband; and when she had concluded, he
arose and took her hand, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“You were right, love. I see it now&mdash;the story of Tom the mechanic has
convinced me that a penny saved is a penny gained: and I shall remember
it.”</p>

<p>Walter Kerr did remember it; and from that day he ceased his nightly
visits to the club. The world prospered with him; and in a short time
there was not a more thriving or a more respected merchant in the town
of H&mdash;&mdash; than Walter Kerr. Every one began to say that he was greatly
indebted for his good fortune to the excellent management of his wife.
Even his parents at length admitted that his marrying Hannah Jerdan was
the most fortunate thing that ever their son Walter did; and he himself
said that she had been worth to him her weight in gold.</p>

<p>They had two children. Their first-born was a boy, and his name was
Francis; and their daughter they had called Jacobini, after an only
brother of Hannah’s and of whom nothing had been heard for many years.
No poet in his waking dreams of domestic bliss hath pictured a happier
pair than were Walter Kerr and his gentle Hannah. She was unto him
as a guardian spirit, an affectionate counsellor, and a friend that
sticketh closer than a brother. And as their children grew up in beauty
before them, like fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> flowers in spring, stealing day by day into
loveliness, so grew their joy.</p>

<p>But, within eight years after his marriage, an unbidden guest&mdash;who
entereth alike the palace and the cottage, whose eye pierceth through
the deepest gloom of the dungeon, as he smiteth the prisoner and saith,
“There is no darkness like unto my darkness”&mdash;placed his noiseless foot
upon the threshold of the prosperous merchant, and with his cold and
poisoned finger touched the bosom of the wife and mother.</p>

<p>Walter Kerr beheld his young, his beautiful, and excellent wife laid
upon her dying bed, with the last breath of life quivering on her lips.
His agony was the wildness, the bitterness of despair. He hung over
her, he wrung his hands, he smote them on his bosom, he wept. He was as
one who hath no hope, and on whom misery&mdash;deep, desolating, everlasting
misery&mdash;had fallen. He would not, he could not be comforted.</p>

<p>“My own!&mdash;my own!” he exclaimed; “I cannot, cannot part with her!”</p>

<p>His was the extremeness of grief. An hour had arrived of the approach
of which he had never thought, or if he had ever imagined that it would
come, he had thought of it as belonging to a day that was far, far
distant, and which might come when age would lead them together gently
to the grave.</p>

<p>The young, the dying wife, stretched forth her trembling and feeble
hand; and as he raised it to his fevered lips&mdash;</p>

<p>“Weep not, dear Walter,” she said falteringly; “but, oh! when I am
gone, be kind to my dear children. And should you&mdash;” she added, but her
voice failed, and tears mingled with the cold dews of death upon her
cheeks. But in a few moments she again added&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>“Walter, should you marry
another, for my sake see that she be as a mother to our children.”</p>

<p>“O Hannah!” he sobbed. Her words entered his agonized bosom like a
barbed instrument, adding sorrow to sorrow, and pain to pain. He
thought of her and of her only, and from the idea of another his soul
revolted.</p>

<p>She called her children to her bedside, and she endeavoured to raise
herself upon her elbow. She kissed them&mdash;she called them by their
names&mdash;her last tears fell upon their cheeks and blended with theirs,
and she bestowed upon them a dying mother’s blessing. She took their
little hands, and placing them in her husband’s, gazed tenderly and
imploringly on his face, and sinking back upon her pillow, with a deep
sigh, her gentle spirit sought the world which is beyond death.</p>

<p>It was a melancholy sight to behold Walter Kerr with his young son
and almost infant daughter in his hands, standing weeping over their
mother’s grave, while the awful, the mortal words, “ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,” were pronounced, and the sound of the cold red earth
falling on the coffin rang rudely on his ears.</p>

<p>For many months there walked not on the earth a more sorrowful widower.
His heart, his hopes, his joys, seemed buried in the grave of her who
had been his wife. His sole consolation was in his children, and he
doted over them with more than a father’s fondness. But he was still
a young man, he was yet a prosperous one, and he had obtained the
reputation of being wealthy.</p>

<p>His wife had been dead somewhat more than four years, when there came
to reside in H&mdash;&mdash; a fair and fashionable maiden, whose name was
Harriet Scott. She soon obtained the reputation of being the greatest
beauty in the town, and was the favourite toast of every bachelor;
amongst whom, if she did not conquer many hearts, she conquered many
eyes; and if she had not lovers, she had manifold admirers. She was
the daughter of an old military man, a major, belonging to some royal
veteran battalion. Beautiful she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> certainly was; but she was vain as
beautiful; and her father’s pay was all that stood between her and
poverty.</p>

<p>There are but few men, and especially mercantile men, who are used
to calculate and consider consequences, that are found guilty of the
folly of offering their hand to a poor and fashionable woman. What
fascination the gay and beautiful Miss Scott threw over our young and
rich widower&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">“What dreams, what charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What conjurations, or what mighty magic”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cannot tell. The gossips of H&mdash;&mdash;, at their tea parties, said she had
“set her cap” at him. But I am not much acquainted with the witchcraft
of “setting a cap,” or how much the term implies. This I know, that
when Walter Kerr first saw Miss Harriet Scott, he thought, what every
person said, “that she was very beautiful,” though he also thought
that she was a vain girl, conscious of her own attractions, and much
too fond of dress and display. But, after he had seen her frequently,
and she spoke with him familiarly, and that, too, in a voice which was
almost as sweet as her face was beautiful&mdash;and when he saw, or thought
he saw, that she smiled on him more frequently and more sweetly than on
any one else&mdash;he began to think that she was an interesting girl, and
by no means the vain creature he had at first imagined her to be. It
is dangerous when a man begins to think a woman interesting. As their
acquaintance grew, he discovered that she had no vanity whatever.</p>

<p>“She is,” thought he unto himself, “the fairest and gentlest being
I have met with since&mdash;I laid my Hannah in the dust,” he would have
continued; but, as the thought arose in his bosom, a tear gathered in
his eyes, a low sigh escaped from him, and a glow overspread his face.</p>

<p>Every day, however, the beautiful Miss Scott became more interesting
in the eyes of the thriving merchant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> his wealth more and more
attractive to her; till in an evil hour he offered her his hand, and
with a sweet blush, like the shadow of a rose leaf on a lily, the
proposal was accepted.</p>

<p>His neighbours said, that, if his first wife had enabled him to make a
fortune, he had got one who would spend it now. And they had not been
husband and wife many months, until events began to shew that there
was some truth in what their neighbours said. The dress of Mrs Kerr
was gayer and far more costly than it had ever been as Miss Scott;
though it was, from its extravagance, a subject of conversation, or
what was called “a town’s talk,” then; and even Walter could not avoid
contrasting, in his own mind, the showy and expensive attire of his
living spouse with the plain and modest neatness of her who was not.
She was kind enough to the children for a time; and she called them
“the little creatures,” and “Kerr’s children.” But she saw them seldom.
“Not,” she said, “that she disliked them, but that she could not be
troubled with children being much about her.”</p>

<p>She was not long, however, in beginning to hint that it was rather
derogatory in a Major’s daughter to have become the wife of a
provincial shopkeeper. The smell of the goods, too, shocked her nerves,
and injured her health.</p>

<p>“The smell from the shop hurt your nerves, dear!” said her husband&mdash;and
the apartments they inhabited were immediately over the shop and
warehouse&mdash;“the smell from the shop hurt you!”&mdash;continued he&mdash;“that is
very strange! My poor Hannah never complained of such a thing, and I’m
sure many a hundred times has she stood in it from morning to night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me, sir, of your Hannah, if you please,” added she; “if
I threw myself away upon you, I was not to be insulted with odious
comparisons about your Hannah.”</p>

<p>“Odious, indeed!” thought Walter, with a sigh; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> durst not
express what he thought; for before this he had begun to discover the
inflammable materials which his wife’s temper was made of.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Kerr,” added she, “the effluvia from your shop is
insupportable. It shocks my nerves continually&mdash;it is killing me
altogether.”</p>

<p>“Truly, my dear,” rejoined he, “I am at a loss to understand ye.
Really every other person you meet talks about their nerves, and being
nervous, now-a-days. But since I can remember, there were no such
words in use&mdash;that is, as they are now applied. For, when we spoke
of anything being nervous, we meant something that was strong and
powerful, such as a nervous sermon, or a nervous speech in the House of
Commons; and if we spoke of a man of nerve, it was a strong-bodied or
a strong-minded man that we meant. But now-a-days the meaning is quite
reversed; and when a person is spoken of as being nervous, or very
nervous, it is always in reference to some silly shaking body, that
has no nerve at all. And it is my candid opinion, dear, that nobody in
this country ever complained of being troubled with the nerves until
spirit-drinking and hot tea-drinking came so much in vogue!”</p>

<p>“O you savage!&mdash;you barbarian!” screamed Mrs Kerr, who seemed to have
been struggling with a hysteric which now came upon her. We have seen
people who have a convenient habit of assuming this pride-produced
malady, and Mrs Kerr was now trying the effect of the experiment upon
her husband; and the violence of the pretended paroxysm increased as he
manifested the more and more tenderness and anxiety to soothe her; and
when she had caused him to believe that he had succeeded in restoring
her to consciousness&mdash;“Kerr,” said she, “we must, if you do not intend
to kill me, leave this horrid house.”</p>

<p>“Leave the house, dear!” said he in surprise&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>“where could we go?”</p>

<p>“Go!” she replied&mdash;“Why don’t you take or build a respectable house out
of the town, where a person could receive their friends. You cannot
expect any genteel person to call upon us here, to be suffocated with
the fumes of your nasty shop and warehouse.”</p>

<p>Walter was once more tempted to speak of his poor Hannah, and was about
to say, that the most genteel people in the town and neighbourhood had
visited her, without once hinting that there was anything disagreeable
to them arising from the proximity of the shop and warehouse, or from
the mixed goods which they contained. But it is a common saying, and
a good one, that “second thoughts are best;” and Walter Kerr thought
twice, and when he did so, he perceived that to speak of his dear and
buried Hannah again, to her who now was to him as she was, would only
be throwing oil upon a flame. He forebore and was silent.</p>

<p>I think&mdash;and so perhaps many of my readers will think&mdash;that, though a
shrewd man, he was of too complying a temper. He was ready to sacrifice
too much for what is called <em>ease</em> and <em>peace</em>. But in so doing, he
was only like many others, whom you will find ready to say&mdash;“Oh, we
are willing to do anything for the sake of peace.” And no doubt this
is a very good spirit; but it may be carried too far. It is quite as
possible for a man to be in error by enduring too much as by allowing
too little. There is a middle path in everything; and it is always
the safest, and generally the best. Extremes are always bad&mdash;so bad,
indeed, that they are like two wild bulls running to encounter each
other, and meeting on a common path, they thrust their horns into the
foreheads of each other, and thus forcibly and painfully become as one
body, to the obstruction of the thoroughfare. But, that Walter Kerr
was too fond of yielding, will be proved from the circumstances of his
having purchased a few acres of ground, and commenced the building <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>of
a country-house, about three miles out of H&mdash;&mdash;, within three months
after the conversation which I have related between him and Mrs Kerr
took place.</p>

<p>Well, the house was finished, and a very neat, and I may say
elegant-looking house it was. They had a garden behind it. Immediately
in front was a parterre, tastefully laid out in plots; and between the
parterre and the highway was a shrubbery, which, from the number of
poplar and other rapid-growing trees in it, was no doubt intended, in a
few years, to have the designation of “a plantation” or “a wood.” But,
after the villa was built, Mrs Kerr discovered that new furniture was
necessary for their new house.</p>

<p>“In truth, Harriet, my dear,” said Mr Kerr, “I can in no way see that
new furniture is necessary. Ye will consider it would be extremely
expensive. All that we have is strong and durable; I can see no fault
with it.”</p>

<p>He would have added, “It was all of my Hannah’s choosing;” but every
day the power of Harriet, her fashionable successor, had increased;
and, although Walter knew not whence that power came, he was but too
conscious of its existence; and he spoke not what he wished to have
said.</p>

<p>To his last remarks she replied&mdash;“O Kerr! Kerr! when shall I get you
to forget your low-life shop and counter? Why did I marry a man that
has no ideas beyond saying ‘Thank you&mdash;I am much obliged to you,’
to every petty penny customer! And a man of your fortune, too!&mdash;Oh,
meanness!&mdash;Kerr, I am ashamed of you.”</p>

<p>He stood out for a considerable time; but, for “the sake of peace,”
he had already yielded to building the villa; and what was once done,
was more easily done again&mdash;therefore he agreed to fit it up with new
furniture. The building and the furnishing of the house cost Mr Kerr no
small sum; and his name did not stand at the bank as worthy of credit
to the amount that it once did. In his moments of solitude he thought
of these things, and sighed.</p>

<p>Yet this was not all: when they had taken possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> the house, and
Mrs Kerr had it, and the new and splendid furniture, with the garden,
the parterre, and the shrubbery, there was something still wanting&mdash;and
that was, a genteel <em>approach</em> to the house. Its present entrance was,
as Mrs Kerr said, “no better than a gate to a cow park&mdash;as vulgar as
the abominable shop and warehouse; and enough to prevent any genteel
person from coming near them.” Indeed, she could not ask them while
they had such an <em>approach</em>.</p>

<p>Yield once to a woman’s caprice, and you may yield always. Two
instances in which he yielded have been mentioned, and he yielded a
third time.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought he, “Harriet will surely be satisfied. I have built her
a fine house, and fitted it up with fine furniture, and I have made her
an avenue to it that a nobleman might enter. Oh, if my dear departed
Hannah could look up, and see the folly into which I have been drawn,
she would shake her head, and say&mdash;‘Walter, Walter!’&mdash;And well she
might.”</p>

<p>And as Walter Kerr thought thus, he burst into tears.</p>

<p>But his wife was not content. The house, the garden, the shrubbery,
the parterre, and the approach were not enough. She wanted her genteel
friends about her, now that she was in a situation to receive them;
and she brought them about her. She treated them, she feasted them.
They were there not only one day in the week, but every day, by
dozens and by scores. Our unfortunate merchant became a cipher in
his own house and at his own table. He had formerly considered what
are called genteel people as a rare sort of individuals, to be met
with occasionally; but he now found them plentiful as gooseberries in
August. They surrounded him like locusts. They were</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Thick as autumnal leaves in Vallombrosa.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>And what surprised him most was, that first one and then another said
to him, during dinner (in accordance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> absurd practice which
still prevails)&mdash;“Mr Kerr, I shall be happy to drink a glass of wine
with you;” and scarce had he swallowed one glass (for he always took
off his heeltaps), until another said the same thing, and another and
another, as though they had entered into concert to fire a regular
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i> at his head; and he thought it a very hard thing that he
could not take a glass of wine in his own house, without caring, or
being told whether those who ate and drank at his expense, were happy
at his drinking or not. Moreover, they acted as though they considered
him honoured by their eating and drinking; and he saw their respect
lavished on his genteel better half, while he was passed over as a sort
of nobody. These were almost every-day doings, and he began to find
that they were making fearful inroads on his cash account; in short, he
discovered that if he had acquired a fortune rapidly during the life of
his first wife, he was spending it as rapidly now.</p>

<p>One day, after a close examination into his books (and it was a very
beautiful day, but there had been wet weather for some time before,
and the roads were bad and disagreeable to walk upon), he returned
home with the determination of saying unto his wife&mdash;“Harriet, it
is impossible for me to stand the course of extravagance we are now
pursuing. I shall be very happy to entertain your friends occasionally;
but really this treating of them every week, I might almost say every
day, is too much for any man in business to stand. Look at my profits
and expenditure during the last three years.” And he had a statement
drawn out.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, this was only a speech which he intended to
deliver in the presence of his wife. Scarce had he sat down in the
parlour where she was, until he perceived, from her looks and manner,
that there was a coming storm; and he knew that the address which he
had prepared would be ill-timed. He therefore sat in silence; but she
did not long follow his example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kerr,” said she, “I don’t know whether you mean to kill me, or what
you mean to do; but I am kept here, mewed up like a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Me keep you mewed up, dear!” said he; “ye certainly know that ye have
full scope and liberty to do as ye please&mdash;ye are mistress of your own
actions.”</p>

<p>“Me mistress of my own actions!” exclaimed she; “me go where I
please!&mdash;what do ye mean? <em>How</em> can I go any where? Would you have me
to go wading through the mire to visit any respectable person?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, my dear!” said he; “but ye can take a fine day for your
visits, when it is dry under foot.”</p>

<p>“O you brute!” exclaimed the delicate Mrs Kerr, “when shall I teach
you to know anything? When shall I get your ideas carried beyond your
counter? Is it not disgraceful to see you trudge, trudging into the
town every day, like some poor beggar that had to work for his bread?”</p>

<p>“Beggars dinna work, hinny,” said he&mdash;“but do not be in a passion.”</p>

<p>“Passion!” cried she; “I tell you what, Kerr&mdash;if you continue to
disgrace me as you have done, I shall never set my foot upon the
outside of your threshold again. Why don’t you get a carriage?”</p>

<p>“A carriage!” he exclaimed, as though a thunderbolt had startled him in
its flight.</p>

<p>“Yes! a carriage,” she resumed&mdash;“I ask you, why don’t you get one?
Don’t tell me you can’t afford it. I know better.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell what ye know, love,” said Mr Kerr; “but a carriage is
out of the question.”</p>

<p>“It is not out of the question,” she resumed; “and question or no
question, you must have one. Do you suppose I am to be kept here like a
nun all my life?”</p>

<p>More conversation of a similar character passed between them; but it
ended in this, that within two months Walter Kerr had a coachman, a
carriage, and a pair of horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>But in noticing the doings of the second Mrs Kerr, I have overlooked
the situation of the children of poor Hannah. I have seen stepmothers
who have been as kind to the children entrusted to their care&mdash;I have
thought even more so&mdash;than if they had been their own. But such,
the reader will already have imagined, was not the treatment of the
children of Hannah Jerdan. Within twelve months from their father’s
marriage, they became subjected to daily, almost hourly scenes of
cruel, petty, and capricious persecution.</p>

<p>But they endured their hard treatment and murmured not. In the society
of each other they were happy&mdash;they spoke of their mother and wept. To
Jacobini she was as a dream-mother&mdash;like the “dream-children” of poor
matchless <span class="smcap">Elia</span>.</p>

<p>But Francis remembered his mother; and by that name he could never be
brought to call her who had now taken her place. Mrs Kerr, indeed,
though she had no children of her own, was wont to say&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t let <em>the creatures</em> call me mother.”</p>

<p>Time had passed on until Francis was a boy, or, perhaps, I should say
a youth, of nearly fourteen, and Jacobini was approaching twelve.
Now, it occurred, that, at the time I refer to, she had offended her
stepmother, in what way I know not; but, according to the statement of
the latter, it was an every-day offence&mdash;although Jacobini was a gentle
child, docile as her mother was. But Mrs Kerr was in an evil humour,
and, after having caused her favourite serving-maid to beat the child
in her presence, not satisfied with the punishment she had received,
she began to chastise her herself.</p>

<p>The cries of little Jacobini reached the ears of her brother, who was
amusing himself in the garden. Although generally a quiet, he was a
bold and passionate boy. He rushed towards the house&mdash;he burst into the
room where his stepmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> was gratifying her cruelty and hatred on his
helpless sister&mdash;he rushed forward.</p>

<p>“Woman!” he cried, in the manner of one whose reason has left him, “if
you strike my sister, I will strike you!”</p>

<p>“Boy!” she exclaimed, in a frenzy; and struck not only his sister
again, but him too, and applied epithets to both, which, for the sake
of human nature, it is as well not to repeat.</p>

<p>I have said that he was bold and passionate&mdash;he was also a tall and
strong boy for his years. He grasped her more fiercely, and as she
continued to vent her rage on both, and to strike at both, he dashed
her to the floor, and exclaimed again&mdash;</p>

<p>“Woman! if you strike my sister, I will strike you!”</p>

<p>At that moment his father entered the house. Hysterics again came to
plead the cause of Mrs Kerr. Walter had seen enough. He seized hold
upon his son. He chastised him&mdash;unmercifully he did so; for he also,
on occasions, was a man of violent passions; but, as with augmented
rage he struck his son, the boy, while he submitted patiently to his
chastisement, gazed in his face with a tearless and stern eye, and
when he had exhausted his rage and strength, the boy turned on him and
said&mdash;“Are you done, sir? I shall tell my mother this!&mdash;<span class="smcap">MY</span>
mother!”</p>

<p>When Walter Kerr heard the words&mdash;“I shall tell <em>my mother</em>,” and
especially the words&mdash;“<span class="smcap">MY</span> mother”&mdash;pronounced by his son, and
the emphatic manner in which they were pronounced, he trembled&mdash;his
heart filled&mdash;he burst into tears, and, stretching out his hand, he
said&mdash;“Francis!”</p>

<p>But the boy exclaimed&mdash;“No!” refused the offered hand, and rushed out
of the room.</p>

<p>Throughout the day he was not again seen; and after many days of
diligent search after him had been made, it was ascertained that he had
entered on board of a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> trading vessel from Newcastle. Twelve
months passed, and the vessel again arrived in Newcastle; but the
captain stated that the astonishing boy (as he termed Francis) had left
him, he knew not for why, nor for where, while they were upon the coast
of Africa, where many vessels were.</p>

<p>The tidings fell sadly on the heart of Walter Kerr; but he had other
evils to contend with. He had lost his son; and with his villa, his
grounds, his carriage, and his visiters, he had lost the half of his
fortune. But the ambition of Mrs Kerr was not yet satisfied. Her
husband did not possess landed property sufficient to think of being a
Justice of the Peace for the county; yet she thought it would give her
additional importance were he chief magistrate in the town of H&mdash;&mdash;.
I will not say that Mr Kerr had not a sprinkling of ambition in his
composition himself, and he more readily agreed that he should aspire
to the honour of being elevated to the bench, than to any other whim
that she had proposed to him. Therefore, after bestowing the necessary
and customary (though illegal) fees on the corporators, which made
another fearful inroad on his monied property, Mr Kerr had the honour
and gratification of being elected chief magistrate of the town of
H&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought he, “Harriet will surely have reached the height of her
ambition; she will be content now.”</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. She not only discovered that the idea of a
magistrate standing behind a counter, and working amongst bales of
goods, or casks of sundry liquors, was intolerable, but she declared
that the effluvia which he brought with him from his warehouse on his
hands and garments, was quite as obnoxious as though she still lived
over it. And further, she added, that you might as well attempt to
wash the Ethiopian white as wash it away. It rendered her incapable of
taking her dinner every day.</p>

<p>Once again, Walter Kerr gave way, “for the sake of peace.” He gave a
share in his business to a shopman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> had been with him for many
years, and became a sleeping partner himself. Jacobini was now a lovely
girl of seventeen; but her persecution had increased with her years,
until it became insupportable. She was treated not only as a servant
but as a slave. Her father beheld what she endured, and he thought of
the dying injunction of his Hannah, and sighed; but his interposition
tended only to increase the sufferings which his daughter endured.</p>

<p>Jacobini possessed all the meekness and patience which had
characterised her mother; but she was persecuted beyond their
endurance. She tied up a few of her clothes, the plainest that she
had, and with the little money which she had been enabled to gather
together, she left her father’s house at the dead of night, and,
wandering towards the next town, took her journey to London, where,
through the instrumentality of a friend of her mother’s, she was in a
few days hired as child’s-maid to a merchant in the city.</p>

<p>Her gentle disposition and acquirements soon rendered her a favourite
with the family; and when they ascertained her history, she became as
one of them.</p>

<p>About this time there was a young man, one William Jerdan, came from
India to be initiated in the mysteries of business by her master. It
was soon evident that he was no uninterested beholder of the gentleness
and beauty of Jacobini. There was, perhaps, something of the ardent
temperament of the clime in which he was born in his composition; and
he suddenly made a declaration of his affection with an enthusiasm
which, while it perhaps pleased, at the same time intimidated the
retiring and the timid Jacobini. She therefore listened not to his
words, and sought to avoid him. But the more her reserve grew, and the
more she endeavoured to shun his presence, the more earnest became
his entreaties, and the more ardent his declarations of affection.
Thus several months passed, and there was a whisper in her heart, that
she could love him, that she <em>did</em> love him; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> she endeavoured to
conquer it. She had often corresponded with her brother, and given him
an account of all that she had endured since the day of his departure.
He was now commander of a large vessel trading between India and the
States of America. She had written to him on the day after her arrival
in London; and about eight months afterwards received from him the
following letter. It was addressed to the care of the friend who had
procured her the situation:<br /></p>

<p class="right">
“<i>New York, August 15th, 18&mdash;.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,&mdash;I cannot describe to you what were my
feelings on receiving your letter, which communicated to me the tidings
that you also had been forced to flee from our father’s house. It is
perhaps sinful in me to do so, but I cannot avoid hating the woman whom
our father would have us to call mother; not on account of her conduct
to me (though it was cruel enough), for I always despised her&mdash;but,
O Jacobini! it was because she was so unlike <em>our</em> mother, whom I
remember better than you can, and whom I suppose you will now resemble
as she lives in my memory&mdash;for all who saw you said, you ‘were her
picture;’ but it is because of her cruelty to you that I hate her. The
thought that you have been compelled to fly more than three hundred
miles from our father’s house, and that your only hope is becoming the
servant of our equals! Sister, when I received your letter and read
this, it cost me a sleepless night; I cried like a child&mdash;and sailors
do not shed tears for trifles. Yea, though I am no Catholic, I prayed
that <em>our</em> mother’s spirit might watch over you and protect you, my
sister! But I cannot endure the thought of your being a menial in the
house of any one. With this, therefore, you will receive a draft for
£100 upon the agents of my owners, payable at sight. The moment that
you get it cashed, leave service, or I shall be angry.</p>

<p>“But now, my own sister, I have something else to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> you of. You
know that our dear mother had a brother called James, and after whom
you were named. He went to sea when but a boy, and was not again heard
of. It was rumoured, and believed, that he and his shipmates were taken
by pirates, and that they became a part of them. The story was not
true. Eighteen months ago, I was in Bengal, and had dealings with a
merchant, who, hearing the Scottish or rather the Border accent on my
tongue, asked me from whence I came. I informed him; and he then, with
a degree of curiosity, inquired who was my father, who my mother. When
I spoke of our father&mdash;‘I remember him well,’ he said; ‘Wat Kerr&mdash;why,
he was my school and class-fellow!’ But when I told him of our mother,
and who she was, there was a visible paleness on his sun-burnt face;
sweat stood in drops upon his brow, he gasped in his eagerness to hear
me, and exclaimed&mdash;‘Youth! youth! does your mother live?’ ‘Oh, no!’
I answered; and the tears gushed into my eyes, sister. ‘Come to me!
come to me! my sister’s child!’ he cried, and he threw his arms around
my neck. Jacobini, it was our uncle&mdash;our mother’s brother. And when
I had told him all, and how and why I had left the house, and spoke
of you, and of your being named after him&mdash;‘If I live,’ said he, ‘for
two years more, I shall see my little niece, my namesake&mdash;she shall be
my daughter.’ He had been many years a prisoner, and on obtaining his
liberty became a sort of secretary to a nabob in India. He had written
repeatedly to his parents; but he received no answer, for ere then
they were dead; and his sister&mdash;our mother&mdash;he knew not whether she
lived, where she was, or by what name she might be found. He is now a
widower, and has an only son, nearly my age. Our cousin, Jacobini, is a
noble, kind-hearted fellow. I should have loved him though he had been
no relative of mine, from the moment I became acquainted with him. His
name is William, and before this reaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> you, he will be in London
where you are; for, when I last left Bengal, he was preparing to go to
London, to be thoroughly instructed in the rules of business. He was to
be in the house of one Mr L&mdash;&mdash;, in Throgmorton Street. By inquiring
there, you will easily find him; and the moment you receive this, call
upon him&mdash;he will rejoice in having found you&mdash;he will protect you
until I see you, which will be in the course of next year; for, after
again going to Bengal, I have a voyage to make to England; and our
uncle has promised to accompany me. Therefore, within twelve months,
we shall meet again. Remember me to my cousin when you find him, which
you will easily do. You may shew him this letter; and when he has seen
it, I am sure you will find in him a warm and a steadfast friend, and
one who will not endure the degradation of your remaining an hour in a
state of servitude.</p>

<p>“Farewell, dear and only sister, until we meet; and if you ever hear
from our father, tell him that I yet live, that I think of him, and
love him&mdash;but, O Jacobini! the <em>woman</em> that rules his house, renders it
impossible that I can again enter it. Write to him that I shall meet
him in London next year, but he must not bring <em>her</em>. Again, farewell,
dear sister&mdash;wait upon our cousin with this letter; it will be an
agreeable surprise&mdash;and I am, ever, your affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Francis Kerr.</span>”<br /><br />
</p>

<p>Such was the letter which Jacobini received from her brother. But it
would be a vain task to describe her feelings, on its perusal. From it
she found that her lover and cousin&mdash;he whom she <em>did</em> love, though
she shewed it not, and whom she sought to avoid&mdash;was one and the same
person. She was commanded to shew the letter to <em>him</em>!</p>

<p>“To <em>him</em>!” said Jacobini; “I cannot.” And yet while she so said she
wept with joy. She went not to him&mdash;nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> needed she; for, as was his
wont, within an hour he threw himself in her way&mdash;for he watched her
every movement. She had never spoken to him unkindly (for it was not in
her nature), but always coldly. She had the letter in her hand, and she
was weeping over it when he saw her.</p>

<p>“Why does my Jacobini weep?” said he: “if aught distresses you, why
refuse the friendship and the hand of one who is ready to bear your
sorrows and protect you?”</p>

<p>“William,” she said, falteringly&mdash;and it was the first time she had
called him by that name&mdash;“read, read this.” And she put the letter into
his hands.</p>

<p>He took it&mdash;his eyes eagerly glanced over it; but before he had
finished it, he flung his arms round her neck, and exclaimed&mdash;“My
cousin!&mdash;my Jacobini!&mdash;mine!”</p>

<p>Her face fell upon his bosom, and she wept. Few words were spoken
between them; but they understood each other. He took her hand in his,
and still holding the letter, he led her to the room of her master and
his mercantile instructor. They were both in tears as they approached
him.</p>

<p>“Master William,” said the merchant, with a look of surprise, “what’s
the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>William put the letter which his fair cousin had received into his
hands. The merchant perused it.</p>

<p>“Miss Kerr,” said he, “I am sorry that I was not sooner acquainted with
your history. If you will, you shall still remain in my house, as a
friend, but not as a menial. My opinion of your cousin William, though
I say it before him, agrees with your brother’s. Whatever his faults
are, they belong to his head, not to his heart, and a little experience
will correct them. I believe I have seen more between you, at least
on his part, Jacobini, than your brother knows. But hitherto, while I
discouraged, I was not displeased at the affection which I saw my young
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing accent"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protegé</i></ins> manifested towards you. And when my friend, your uncle and
his father,” (for he spoke to Jacobini),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> “arrives in England, I shall
rejoice not only in being able to introduce to him his niece, but in
recommending a daughter.”</p>

<p>As the merchant spoke, William and Jacobini hung their heads, and tears
and blushes were on their cheeks together.</p>

<p>She remained in the house; and I need hardly say, that her cousin now
looked upon her as his betrothed; and in the same manner did she regard
him.</p>

<p>Before twelve months went round, her brother and her uncle arrived in
London. It would be a vain task in me to picture their interview&mdash;to
describe their joy&mdash;to pourtray their surprise. The reader will imagine
it more vividly. Why should I tell how the brother wept upon the neck
of his sister, and how her tears fell on his bosom; or how the merchant
drew her uncle aside, and in a few words told him the affection that
existed between his son and his niece, and of the worth of both. Nor
need I tell how James Jerdan, after listening to the merchant, came
forward with a full heart, and in one hand taking the hand of his
niece, and in the other that of his son, joined them, saying&mdash;“Bless my
children!”</p>

<p>Within a month, the indissoluble knot was tied between William and
Jacobini, and they went down to Scotland to spend their honeymoon, her
brother accompanying them; but her father-in-law refused to go with
them, as he thought his presence might not be acceptable to her who was
now the wife of his late sister’s husband.</p>

<p>Jacobini had never heard from her father, though she had often written
to him, since she left his house. But from the day that she departed,
ruin had followed fast upon him. When he left his business, because
his wife was ashamed of it, business became ashamed of him. Her
extravagance increased, and his property decreased. His villa, his
carriage, his all that never should have belonged to him, became a jest
among his neighbours. He was declared a bankrupt&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> was cast into
prison. The villa and the surrounding grounds were sold, the carriage
was sold, and his wife went to reside with her father, who was then
upon his death-bed.</p>

<p>When Jacobini, her husband, and her brother, arrived in H&mdash;&mdash;, they
found their father a captive in a prison-house. They entered the prison
to see him; and when he beheld them, he knew only his daughter. But
they all, they each embraced him; they called him “<span class="smcap">Father</span>!”
and the poor man wept, even as a child weeps. He spoke of their
mother&mdash;he entreated their forgiveness; but his son and his daughter
clung around his neck, and cried&mdash;“Say nothing, father!”</p>

<p>They sent for his solicitor. His son and his son-in-law paid his debts
in the prison. They led him out in their arms. They sent for his wife,
the gay Miss Scott, that was their cruel stepmother, her father had
died about a week before, and she was left destitute, having ruined her
husband.</p>

<p>“I will support my father,” said Francis; “but I will have nothing to
do with maintaining <em>that woman</em>.”&mdash;for she had been sent for against
his wish.</p>

<p>“Then I will support her,” said Jacobini&mdash;“William, will not you?”
she added, addressing her husband. “Let bygones be bygones&mdash;she is my
father’s wife&mdash;she must have cared for me before I could have cared for
myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, love, yes, we will support her,” said her husband.</p>

<p>They did as they had said. Walter Kerr lived in comfort on an annuity
which his children allowed him; and his wife, while she partook of it,
repented because of her extravagance, and because of her cruelty to
those from whose bounty she was now fed. Jacobini went with her husband
and her father-in-law to India, where in a few years a happy family
gamboled around them, and Francis increased in wealth, but lived a
bachelor, and left his property to his sister’s children.</p>

<h2>THE DISSOLVED PLEDGE.</h2>


<p>“Hold hard!” said the coachman, as he gathered up his reins, and
flourished his whip&mdash;and away lumbered the heavy afternoon coach, for
the South, from the door of the coach office. It was full inside,
with only one outside passenger. After it was fairly out of the town,
and the road had become comparatively clear of carts and carriages,
the coachman, after two or three quiet, reconnoitering glances at the
gentleman who occupied the box-seat, tucked the apron comfortably over
his knees, and having settled himself to his own satisfaction, began to
weary of so long a silence, and endeavoured to break the spell by the
novel and interesting remark&mdash;“It’s a fine afternoon, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>A long pause.</p>

<p>“Fine horses these, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Another long pause.</p>

<p>“Queer fish this,” muttered the coachman to himself. “I wonder if
he can say No. I’ll try him once more. Take snuff, sir?” said he,
thrusting the mull under the nose of his victim.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” followed by an impatient rustling of his cloak, and
a restless movement on the seat.</p>

<p>The coachman gave up the matter in despair, and was obliged to content
himself with holding agreeable converse with his cattle, in which he
certainly had the best of it, as they bore all he chose to inflict, in
silence.</p>

<p>The man of few words was a youth of one or two-and-twenty, of pleasing
and gentlemanly exterior; and, although the <em>coachman</em> looked with
great contempt upon one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> would not take snuff, and who did not
admire his favourite horses, we hope he will prove an object of greater
interest to our readers, as he is to be the hero of our story. Poor
fellow! no wonder that he wore such an air of sadness and abstraction,
and that he shrank from the well-meant, though obtrusive advances of
the knight of the whip. Most of us have experienced&mdash;and who that
has experienced can ever forget?&mdash;the feelings of mingled sorrow and
hope with which we have, for the first time in our lives, turned our
backs upon the home of our childhood, and were fairly launched, on our
own responsibility, into the untried ocean of life. How fondly did
our thoughts rest upon the much-loved scenes we were leaving behind
us! how vividly did we recall each look and action of those nearest
and dearest to our hearts! and how perseveringly did we cling to our
sorrowful yet pleasing recollections, shutting our eyes and ears to the
vulgar sights and sounds of every-day life around us, and shrinking
from communication with our fellow-men, as if our sorrow were “a thing
apart,” too sacred to be unveiled to the eyes of others. Such were
the feelings of young Edward Malcolmson, our silent friend. <em>He</em> was
leaving, for the first time, a mother he tenderly loved, sisters who
doted on him, and, last, though not least, he was leaving one who was
dearer to him than them all&mdash;one whom he <em>then</em> thought, as most of
us have thought once in our lives, he would never, never forget&mdash;the
joy of his heart, the light of his eyes (as the poets word it), his
first, his only love. No wonder, then, that he flapped his travelling
cap down over his ears, folded his arms on his breast, and, fixing his
eyes upon the footboard, sat the very image of determination&mdash;to be
miserable. Night was closing around, but the darkness was congenial to
his feelings; he could now indulge them unobserved, and he abandoned
himself to them without control. He felt the same kind of listlessness
and prostration of mental energy which those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> experience who suffer
from sea-sickness; so much so, that when a sudden gust of wind whisked
his cap off his head, he was too completely victimised even to mention
his loss to the coachman.&mdash;“Let it go! What do I care? O Jessy!”</p>

<p>The latter part of this effusion he unconsciously uttered aloud.</p>

<p>“That’s the name of my near wheeler, sir,” said the coachman, glad
to hear dummy speak at last, and still more delighted to have
an opportunity of hearing <em>himself</em>. What a strange mixture of
inconsistencies is the creature man! This ludicrous and unexpected
appropriation of his beloved one’s name, tickled Edward Malcolmson’s
fancy; and he who the moment before had thought himself the most
miserable dog in existence, burst into an extravagant fit of laughter.
The coachman was delighted with the success of his random remark; and
it was with a chuckle of unaffected, kind-hearted pleasure, that he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“It does my heart guid to hear ye laugh. Naething like it, sir, for
keeping a body gaucie an’ comfortable.”</p>

<p>The ice was broken; the conversation was kept up for some time&mdash;at
first only in monosyllables, on Edward’s part; but he could not long
resist the contagion of the man’s persevering merriment, and he
gradually shook off the weight which had before almost overpowered
his spirit. Sorrow gave way to hope for the future, and, with all
the sanguine buoyancy of youth, he already, in fancy, began business
for himself, in an extensive way, as a builder&mdash;of castles in the
air. Those castles in the air, those bubbles of fancy, how soon do
they crumble away, and burst amid the jostling realities of life! How
soon are our eyes opened to their hollowness and vanity! The visions
of early hope are like the rainbow&mdash;bright and beautiful it appears
before us, spanning half the heavens with its brilliant arch, and
fading even while we gaze upon it. Fleeting, yet delightful dreamings
of fancy! whither have ye fled? Gone, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> buoyant spirits and
unchilled affections of youth; and we, the seared and world-hardened,
sigh when we look back to you, to think that ye have proved to be
but delusions. But a truce to sentiment; it is time that we should
introduce our hero to our readers, to do which satisfactorily, we must
glance backwards to a period some thirty years anterior to the date of
our story, and give some account of his parents.&mdash;Mrs Malcolmson was
the widow of a substantial tradesman in Edinburgh, who had been dead
for some years, having left her in tolerably comfortably circumstances,
with two daughters and one son, the Edward of our story. She was a
woman of manners and education far superior to her husband’s station
in life&mdash;the only daughter of an Irish family of distinction, in the
neighbourhood of Cork, and moving in the first circles there. She had
been attracted by the personal appearance and agreeable manners of a
young subaltern in a regiment quartered in that city. Philip Denby
was a man well calculated to catch the fancy of a young and romantic
girl. To great personal attractions, he united the most polished, yet
unaffected manners; was highly accomplished, and was blessed, moreover,
with an excellent disposition. But, with all these advantages, young
Denby had one drawback&mdash;a drawback of no slight importance in the
eyes of worldly-minded mammas, and of their prudent daughters&mdash;he was
poor. They were all loud in his praise&mdash;so elegant, so delightful, so
interesting! They all agreed in thinking that no man dressed better,
made a more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</i> figure in a ball-room, or a more agreeable
one in general society; but then, poor fellow, what would all that do
for him?&mdash;he had nothing but his pay to depend upon. The consequence
was, that, though the “admired of all admirers,” the young subaltern
was looked upon as a “detrimental;” and the mammas, while they were
eager to have so handsome an <em>officer</em> to grace their parties, were
unwearying in their warnings and admonitions to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> daughters, to
beware of any serious entanglement with so poor a <em>man</em>. In general,
these hints were not thrown away; but there was one, and she was the
best and loveliest of the circle, who turned a deaf ear to them all.
She listened only to the whisperings of her own heart, which told her
that Philip Denby, poor in purse, was rich in all the qualities which
adorn a man. Philip had long admired Ellen O’Connor, but as he would
have admired a star in the distant sky&mdash;so great was the disparity
which, to his sensitive mind, there appeared to be between their
respective stations in life. She was the beautiful and only child
of rich and purse-proud parents, and entitled to look forward to an
alliance with the rich and high-born; while he, though a gentleman by
birth, and so far her equal, had nothing but his profession to depend
upon. Hitherto he had escaped, “fancy free,” from all the dangers
which surrounded him in the shape of bright eyes and beautiful forms;
he felt flattered by the attentions which were everywhere paid him by
the young and fair; but the very general popularity he enjoyed, was
the best safeguard of his heart; all smiled upon him, and he in return
smiled upon all, without feeling particular regard for any. He had come
to the magnanimous resolution, that he was too poor to marry a poor
woman, and too proud to marry a rich one&mdash;and he was in a fair way to
become a regular male flirt, when he first met Ellen O’Connor. We will
not attempt to enter into a description of Miss O’Connor’s beauty,
particularly as it lay more in expression than in feature; such as it
was, however, all Philip’s philosophy sank before it, like snow before
a sunbeam. We shall merely remark, that she had eyes dark as her raven
hair, with the light of a bright, and joyous, and confiding spirit
flashing through them; the rest we leave to the imagination of our
readers&mdash;for</p>

</div></div>

<p>Our limits will not allow us to enter into particulars. If this were
a novel, instead of a tale of real life, we might follow the course
of their love, step by step, and expatiate upon the stolen glances,
the tender <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</i>, and all the sentimental etceteras which
usually form the burden of a tale of love&mdash;fortunately for our
readers, we must, perforce, spare them the infliction. Suffice it,
that their mutual attachment soon became the subject of common remark
and conversation; and, at last, those who were most interested, and,
as usual, most blind, were enlightened by the hints and charitable
warnings of sundry busy, good-natured friends. Dire was the wrath of
old O’Connor, when his eyes were opened to the truth: he cursed his own
blind folly, for having allowed matters to go so far; cursed (but not
aloud, he was too prudent for that) the wife of his bosom, for having
been as blind as himself; and cursed every red coat that ever was
made, and every unfortunate wight who had ever worn one. At length he
remembered the legitimate object of his wrath, and hastened out of the
house in search of Denby. Fortunately for them both&mdash;for Philip was not
a man to bear unmerited abuse with patience&mdash;he failed in his object;
Philip was not to be found at his lodgings, at the reading rooms, or
at the billiard-table, for the best of all reasons&mdash;that he was seated
beside Ellen O’Connor, not five minutes after her father had left her.
While the one was leaving the house in one direction, the other was
arriving at it by another. Philip found her in tears; and, in answer to
his impassioned and alarmed inquiries, she gave him an account of the
scene she had just witnessed, and implored him, if he had any affection
for her, to bear patiently the intemperance which, she feared, her
father would indulge in if they should meet. He calmed her fears on
that score, and they had a long and interesting conversation, the
result of which was, the conviction that it was impossible for them to
live without each other. What arguments the philosopher, Denby, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
use of, we know not; but the result was, that, in three days, Ellen
O’Connor eloped from her father’s house in his company. Some weeks
passed gaily and happily over the heads of the young couple; but they
were soon awakened from their dream of love and bliss, by the sterner
realities of life. The story of old O’Connor’s aversion to the match,
and his loud and angry invectives against his daughter, had gone
abroad, and Philip’s creditors became pressing in their demands for
payment. Ruin stared them in the face; and Ellen, whose fear of meeting
her justly-incensed father had hitherto prevented her from seeking his
forgiveness, was determined to brave the interview she dreaded. With a
faltering step she sought her father’s dwelling; and her heart smote
her, when she thought how happy that home had been, till she introduced
sorrow and disappointment there. The house was shut up&mdash;the family had
left it in charge of a single servant, who delivered to Ellen a letter
that had been left for her by her father, in case of her return. It
contained merely the following words:&mdash;“Ungrateful girl! As you have
sown so must you reap: you are an outcast from my home and heart for
ever! Never presume to approach this house again.” With eyes blinded
with tears, and a heart swelling with anguish, she returned to her
husband, who was anxiously awaiting the result of her visit.</p>

<p>“Well, dearest?” said he.</p>

<p>“He has rejected me for ever, Philip!” sobbed she, as she threw herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>“Grieve not, my love!” said Denby, while his anxious look and heavy
sigh betrayed how much he himself needed consolation&mdash;“are we not all
in all to each other?” And, as he embraced his young and lovely wife,
he forgot, for a moment, the world and all its cares. By the sale of
his commission, he contrived to raise money enough to pay his trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
debts, and to support himself and his wife for some months in strict
economy; but that temporary supply diminishing rapidly, he was obliged
to apply to some of his numerous friends to exert their interest,
or open their purses in his favour. Disappointment followed all his
applications; and, harrassed in mind and wearied in body, he lay down
on the bed of sickness and sorrow, from which he never rose again. He
just lived long enough to see and bless his newly-born infant, leaving
his wife to struggle with poverty and grief. Mrs Denby’s sorrow was at
first excessive; and serious fears were, for some time, entertained
by her medical man, for her life; but youth and a good constitution
carried her through. She was a woman of warm and passionate feelings,
and her grief soon exhausted itself by its violence. Besides, it
is one of the blessings of poverty, that it allows no time for
brooding over sorrow, but calls for active and constant exertion,
to ward off the evils it entails. In her distress&mdash;for she was left
almost destitute&mdash;she again applied to her father; but he continued
inexorable, and sternly refused to see her. His example was followed by
the rest of her family connections, all of whom were, or affected to
be, indignant at her conduct. A maternal uncle, however, pitying her
destitution, promised to settle a small annuity upon her, and to bring
up and provide for her infant son, on condition that she would never
interfere with his education, and would leave the country within six
months.</p>

<p>Severe as these conditions were, she at last agreed to them, though to
do so cost her many a bitter tear; but, when she thought of her own
destitute condition, and of the brighter prospects which the proposed
arrangement would open to her son, she struggled to suppress the
fond yearnings of a mother’s affection, and to close with an offer
which she hoped would be for her boy’s future benefit. It was with an
agonised heart she tore herself from her little Philip, whose uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
received him with the greatest delight, and solemnly promised to be
to him as a father. She then bade adieu for ever to her native land,
after having again ineffectually endeavoured to obtain her father’s
forgiveness. In two years’ time, she was again a wife and a mother. Mr
Malcolmson, a respectable Scottish tradesman, when on a visit to some
friends in Cork, had accidentally seen the young widow, at the time
when her late bereavement, and her family’s cruel rejection of her,
excited universal sympathy and commiseration; and when he afterwards
met her in Edinburgh, where she was living in humble seclusion, he
contrived to form her acquaintance; and, in a few months, made her a
formal offer of his hand and fortune. Mrs Denby received his addresses
with graceful and grateful acknowledgments; but told him that she
had no heart to bestow, that her affections were buried in the grave
with her husband, and that she could never love another. “If you
cannot <em>love</em> me as your husband,” replied he, “you may respect and
esteem me&mdash;you may look upon me as your friend, your guardian, your
protector&mdash;as one whose pride and pleasure it will be to anticipate
all your desires, and to shield you from all annoyances.” In her union
with the worthy and amiable Malcolmson, Ellen Denby was blessed with
a recompense for all her past distresses: for ten years he was to her
the kindest of husbands, the most affectionate of friends; and the
only unhappy moment she experienced during her union, was that on
which it was about to be dissolved for ever. He left her comfortably
provided for, with three children&mdash;two girls, and a boy, the hero of
our tale. Edward Malcolmson, at the time of his father’s death, was a
boy of excellent dispositions; and, as he grew up, he amply fulfilled
the promise of his childhood. He was a young man of solid rather
than brilliant talents; mild and gentlemanly in his manners; slow to
form plans, but persevering and determined in following them out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
He had received a medical education, and had distinguished himself
by his close application to his studies, and by his rapid progress
in professional acquirements. Through the interest of some of his
late father’s friends, he had obtained an appointment on the Bengal
establishment; and was, at the time of the commencement of our story,
on his way to London, there to join the ship that was to convey him
abroad. Mrs Malcolmson’s nearest neighbour in Edinburgh, was a widow
lady, named Martin, who, like herself, was living in comfortable,
though not affluent circumstances. Her only daughter, Jessie, was her
mother’s darling, and well deserved the affection which was lavished
upon her. She was about the same age as Edward Malcolmson, and, without
being absolutely lovely, there was a charm in her simple, unaffected
manners, and in the ingenuous expression of her countenance, which,
added to an uncommonly fine figure and sweet voice, gave her the
advantage over others who far excelled her in mere beauty of feature.
Between her mother and Mrs Malcolmson, the closest intimacy had existed
for several years; indeed, they had lived so secludedly, that they had
hardly any acquaintances beyond the circle of their own families. The
consequence was, that the young people were almost constantly in each
other’s society; and their parents remarked, with pleasure, the mutual
attachment which seemed to be springing up between them. They did,
indeed, feel a warmer regard for each other than is often the result
of such constant and close intimacy; for it is but too often the case
with human character as it is with the face of nature&mdash;“’Tis distance
lends enchantment to the view.” But it was not till the time of
Edward’s departure approached, that they became mutually aware how dear
they were to each other. The morning before leaving Edinburgh, young
Malcolmson called to bid adieu to his friends. Mrs Martin happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to be out walking, and Jessie was sitting alone in the parlour, when
Edward was ushered in. She turned pale when she saw him; for her heart
sunk at the prospect of their approaching separation.</p>

<p>“Jessie,” said he, after they had sat in silence some minutes, “I have
come to bid you farewell.”</p>

<p>“I feared so,” said she, striving in vain to repress her tears.</p>

<p>“Do not&mdash;do not cry, dear Jessie,” exclaimed he, starting up, and
seizing her hand, while his own eyes were dimmed with tears&mdash;“I cannot
bear to witness your distress.”</p>

<p>“Would you have me look happy and cheerful, when my old friend and
companion is going to leave me, perhaps never to return?”</p>

<p>“Companion, Jessie! friend!&mdash;these are cold words to me, whose whole
heart is yours; who live but in the light of your smile; who love you
as I have never before loved human being, and never shall love again.
Jessie! dear Jessie! tell me that I do not love in vain; give me one
word of hope to cheer me during my painful absence. Will you not
answer, dearest?”</p>

<p>She turned her tearful eye up to his face, and then, hiding her
blushing cheek upon his arm, she murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>“What would you have me say, Edward? We have been dearer to each other
than brother and sister; we have been dreaming a pleasant dream, and
now we are awakening from it; we are about to part, perhaps never to
meet again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, dearest! we shall meet again. The world is all before me, and
I have youth and energy to carry me through it. Only tell me that, if
fortune favours my exertions, you will smile upon me; and the hope of
one day calling you mine, will cheer me under misfortune, and encourage
me to renewed efforts. Only tell me that you will not forget me, and I
here vow, as soon as I have obtained a competency, to return and claim
you for my bride.”</p>

<p>“Make no rash promises, Edward! We are both young, and have neither of
us seen much of the world, or of others. You know what your favourite
song says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">‘Change o’ fowk and change o’ scene<br /></span>
<span class="i8">May gar thy fancy jee.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Never, Jessie, never!”</p>

<p>But we will not weary our readers with any more of this easily imagined
effusion. They parted under a mutual agreement of fidelity to each
other: how well they adhered to it remains to be shewn.</p>

<p>We will not follow Edward Malcolmson on ship-board, nor attempt to
describe that most uninteresting of all uninteresting things, a
<em>pleasant</em> passage; but will merely state that he arrived in safety
at Calcutta, where he soon rendered himself conspicuous by his
active discharge of the duties imposed upon him. His zeal and talent
attracted the notice of the ruling powers, and he obtained a lucrative
appointment at the Presidency, the salary of which, added to the
liberal fees he received in private practice, soon enabled him to
clear off the debts he had unavoidably contracted at his outset, and
to lay the foundation of a rapidly increasing fortune. The habits of
his previous life rendered it an easy task for him to unite the most
careful economy with a liberal and gentlemanly expenditure. He had been
early taught that true economy consists in restraining our desire for
the <em>superfluities</em>, not in debarring ourselves from the enjoyment of
the <em>comforts</em> of life. His careful regulation of his expenses, and
his indifference to show and parade enabled him, on proper occasions,
to give greater scope to the natural generosity of his disposition
than he otherwise could have done. Esteemed for the steadiness and
consistency of his character, and beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> for his kind and amiable
qualities, he soon became one of the most popular men of his class in
Calcutta, besides having deservedly acquired the reputation of being
one of the most skilful. Fortune had thus far favoured him beyond his
most sanguine expectations; and, in so expressing ourselves, we do no
injustice to his merits; for how often are the most splendid talents
lost to the world, even when seconded by persevering energy, for want
of opportunity for their display? At a comparatively early age, he had
nearly attained the summit of his profession; he had far outstripped
those who had started with him in the race for wealth and distinction;
he was generally and deservedly beloved and respected&mdash;and yet he was
not happy. “Change o’ fowk, and change o’ scene,” <em>had</em> made a great
alteration in those feelings which, with the fond enthusiasm of youth,
he had thought would remain unshaken for ever; and the recollection of
his engagement to Jessie Martin, which was once his greatest solace,
now hung like a cloud over his spirits. For two or three years, her
image had been ever present to his thoughts, and had formed his
principal incentive to exertion; but Time had been gradually dimming
his memory of the past. He began almost unconsciously to regret having
so inconsiderately shackled the freedom of his inclinations, and, when
he gazed on the many lovely forms around him, he wished he had followed
Jessie’s advice, not to bind himself by a formal promise, until he had
seen more of the world and of the people in it. The engagement had
been made, however, and true to his principles, he was determined to
adhere to it, although, to do so, he was obliged resolutely and firmly
to avoid the society of one who had begun to usurp Jessie’s place in
his affections. He had written home from time to time, giving a full
account at first of his flattering prospects, and of the hope that
cheered him on in his path; and now, after a lapse of eight years
since his arrival in India, he wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> say that fortune had so far
favoured him, that he considered himself justified in thinking of
making a change in his condition. He told not of his cool and altered
feelings&mdash;he considered it his duty to conceal them, and to adhere
to his engagement, even at the sacrifice of his happiness; and he
wrote to claim the fulfilment of Jessie’s promise, and to beg her,
if her feelings remained the same towards him, to come out to him
by the first opportunity. Time had been busy also with Jessie. Long
separation had gradually weakened her affection for Edward; and a freer
intercourse with the world and with society, had produced its natural
effect&mdash;a love of change and variety. She had been much and generally
admired, and, although very guarded in her behaviour, and cool and
distant in her manners to the young men who flocked around her, had
received several very advantageous offers, which she had instantly
and decidedly rejected, as she considered herself in honour bound
to adhere to her early engagement. Her feelings towards Edward had,
however, lost their freshness and warmth, and had gradually acquired a
tone of indifference; and although she had formed no other particular
attachment, she grieved to think that she could not participate in
the constancy of affection which <em>seemed</em> to pervade his letters to
her. Thus were they mutually deceived, and each looked forward with
anxiety and alarm to the period of their meeting, which was now not
far distant, as Jessie had received Edward’s invitation, and had
announced her intention of taking her passage in the <i>Lady Flora</i> which
was shortly to sail for Calcutta. It was with but little of the joy
of a bride-expectant, that she began her preparations for her voyage;
for she was conscious that she had none of that feeling of devoted
attachment to her betrothed which a woman ought to have towards the man
whom she is to vow at the altar, to “love honour, and obey.”</p>

<p>We must leave her to complete her arrangements, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> recall the
readers’ attention to one who must, by this time, we fear, almost have
escaped from their recollection&mdash;young Philip Denby, whom we left in
Ireland, under the guardianship of his uncle. The lovely child had
grown up a handsome and promising youth, and had endeared himself to
his uncle by his grateful and affectionate disposition. He had received
all the advantages which wealth and liberality could bestow, and,
though avowedly the intended heir to his uncle’s handsome fortune, had
been brought up in the strictest habits of business and regularity.
His gay, light-hearted, joyousness of spirit, his frank and engaging
manners&mdash;had made him a general favourite; but, fortunately for him,
he had been taught to regulate his conduct by strict principle, and he
always kept in mind that the best mode of retaining the good opinion
of others, is by continuing to deserve it. He was not, as is too
often the case, spoiled by the attention he met with; but it had, on
the contrary, the good effect of stimulating him to persevere in the
path of duty. He knew nothing of his mother but by the letters which
she periodically wrote to inquire after his welfare, and often and
deeply did he lament the family feud which separated them; but he had,
from his earliest years, looked upon his uncle as a father, and was
obliged, in duty, to conform to his prejudices. Old O’Connor never
forgot nor forgave his daughter’s indiscretion. He had been proud of
her&mdash;proud of her beauty and of her accomplishments&mdash;and had looked
forward with delight to the prospect of one so favoured by nature and
fortune forming a brilliant alliance; for, like most men with little
minds and long purses, he sighed for what wealth alone could not
bestow&mdash;good family connection. In this dearest hope of his heart, she
had disappointed him; and his wounded pride had converted what little
affection he once had had for her, into the bitterest enmity. This
feeling extended even to his innocent grandson, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> refused on
all occasions to notice, remarking that an “ill bird must have an ill
brood.” But we will say no more of him or his prejudices: such feelings
are as monstrous and unnatural, as, fortunately, they are rare. Mr
Morton, Philip’s uncle, had made his fortune in the East Indies, and
had still an interest in a large mercantile house in Calcutta, which
place he had twice visited during his protegé’s school days, and while
he was pursuing his studies at college, under the surveillance of
an old and esteemed friend. It was Mr Morton’s intention once more
to visit the East; but a severe attack of illness had shattered his
constitution, and obliged him to give up all hopes of prosecuting his
intention. Philip had attained the age of two-and-thirty, when alarming
accounts were received of the instability of several of the great
commercial houses in India. This news excited old Morton’s fears; and
his anxiety on the subject had a fatal effect upon his nerves, shaken
and debilitated by previous illness. He felt that he had not long to
live, and, in expectation of approaching dissolution, he made his will,
by which he left all he was possessed of to Philip, on condition that
he took the name of Morton. He earnestly enjoined Philip to hasten to
Calcutta, and, as his representative, to assist, to the utmost of his
ability, the house with which he was connected, in the distress which
he foresaw was impending over it. Before Philip could prepare to comply
with his wishes, however, the old man became so alarmingly ill that his
life was despaired of, and, though he rallied wonderfully for a time,
a relapse, brought on by incautious exposure to the air, proved fatal,
and Philip was left a second time fatherless. Sadly and sincerely
did he mourn the loss of his affectionate and liberal protector&mdash;his
earliest, his kindest, his constant friend. As soon as circumstances
would allow, he hastened to fulfil his deceased uncle’s wishes, and,
crossing the Channel, after a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> equipment for his voyage, he
hurried down to Portsmouth to join a ship on the point of sailing for
Calcutta. The passengers were all on board, and the vessel was only
waiting for a fair wind to proceed to sea. Two days afterwards, they
were dashing along down Channel, with a favourable wind, with a bright
sky over their heads, and with the cheering hope of a good passage.
The animated and novel scene excited Philip’s admiration, and cheered
his spirits. The bright and beautiful face of Nature, under an aspect
so new to him; the sunbeams glancing from the crested waves; the white
foam breaking under the vessel’s bow; the exhilarating sense of rapid
motion, as the water hissed and rustled alongside; the rapidly-receding
landmarks on the shore; and the joyous faces of the crew&mdash;all conspired
to distract his thoughts for a while from the grief which had weighed
down his spirits. Several of the gentlemen passengers were on deck,
enjoying the beauty of the scene; but none of the ladies, of whom he
heard there were three or four on board, had yet made their appearance.
At eight o’clock, the steward announced, “Spirits on the table, sir;”
but Philip heeded him not. Now that the first excitement of novelty
was over, his thoughts reverted to the home he had so lately left,
and to the dear and valued benefactor he should never see again;
and he leaned sorrowfully over the gangway, to indulge his mournful
retrospections. From these reveries he was soon roused, by the sound of
suppressed voices close to him; and, on turning round to see whence it
proceeded, he perceived, through the dim light, the figures of two of
the crew stretched at full length on the deck, close to the foremost
quarter-deck carronade, and under the lee of the bulwark. Now that his
attention was awakened, he could distinctly hear every word of their
conversation, which amused and interested him greatly, and which he
considered himself perfectly justified in benefiting by, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> he had
given them fair warning of his proximity, by observing to them, “It’s a
fine night, lads.”&mdash;and receiving the answer, “Yes, sir, it is.”</p>

<p>“My eyes, Bill!” said one of the recumbents, “ain’t this here a fine
breeze?”</p>

<p>“Wait till ye sees the end on’t, Jem,” replied the other; “it’s my
notion ye’ll change your tune before long.”</p>

<p>“Mayhap I may, Bill; but I hates to be watching the weather-glass of
evil. What makes you so down in the mouth?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye what, Jem&mdash;I don’t like this here move at all. I never
seed no good come of sailing on a Friday. Why couldn’t the skipper
have kept her fast by the nose for another day, ’stead of running in
the very teeth of mischief in this way? I wonders as how the Admiralty
doesn’t give an order agin sailing on sich an unlucky day.”</p>

<p>“Why, sure, Bill, you don’t call sich a breeze as this unlucky? If this
is what you call Friday’s luck, I hope I may always sail on a Friday.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see, Jem; but, if so be as you doesn’t think that there’s
bad luck in a Friday, you’re out of your latitude, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Watch, man the royal cluelines!” interrupted the men in their confab,
and startled all the watch to their feet. The breeze was gradually
freshening, and the small masts were beginning to complain; but the
night was clear, and cold, and beautiful&mdash;and Philip retired to his
cot, laughing at the superstitious fears of the sailor, but, at the
same time, unconsciously almost to himself, affected by them. The
breeze continued steady till they had cleared the Channel, and were
standing to the south, when it began gradually to die away and draw
a-head; and, on the night of the third day from their departure, the
scene was completely changed. Thick, heavy masses of cloud had been
gathering to the southward all the afternoon; cloud after cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
rearing its dark head, and then remaining stationary, like an army
assembling all its forces before being put in motion. Towards night,
the breeze began to freshen from the southward, and the clouds to rise
slowly and sullenly, as if compelled unwillingly to tear themselves
from their resting-place on the horizon, while the light “scud” drove
rapidly across, high up in the heavens. A large, dull halo surrounded
the moon, and her light struggled dimly and ominously through the
watery and angry-looking vapours that flitted across it. Everything
portended a coming storm; the ship herself seemed to be aware of the
approaching conflict, plunging and rolling as if in ineffectual efforts
to make her escape; while her timbers groaned and creaked, as she
tossed about in the confused sea, and seemed to utter mournful cries,
as the wind moaned in hollow gusts through her rigging. All the small
sails were taken in, and soon the loud order to “reef topsails” was
heard, followed by the rattling of blocks, the flapping of sails, and
the loud cheers of the sailors, as they plied their dangerous trade
aloft. The double-reefed topsails were soon set, the yards braced
sharp up, and the ship stood away to the westward, throwing thick
sprays over her bow, and trembling from stem to stern, as she plunged
heavily into the sea, and, rising again, poured whole torrents of
water from her head. Philip felt an excitement he had never before
experienced, as he gazed on the scene around him. The wild, threatening
sky; the angry waves, like wild beasts lashing themselves into fury;
the gradually-freshening gale, howling as if in search of its prey;
and the moon herself&mdash;the mild, placid moon&mdash;scowling down upon the
turmoil below, with a frown upon her brow&mdash;all united to form a picture
of gloom and desolation, which accorded well with his own feelings. He
stayed on deck till near the end of the first watch, and was just going
down to his cabin, when the second mate, whose watch it was, said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must be cold and wet, Mr Morton. If you will wait a few minutes,
till I am relieved, I shall be glad of your company in my cabin, to
smoke a cigar over a glass of grog, for it is of little use turning in.
This night’s work is not over yet, or I’m much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Morton; “I shall be happy to join you.”</p>

<p>As soon as the deck was relieved, they dived below, to the snugly
fitted-up cabin of the second mate, where they soon forgot the clouds
above, while enveloped in clouds of their own raising below.</p>

<p>“It is the fashion, Mr Morton,” said Hardy, the officer, “among many
of the sticklers for propriety, to rail at the use of what they
have no relish for themselves, and to denounce smoking as a low
and ungentlemanly practice; but, in spite of all their squeamish
objections, I know nothing more soothing and refreshing, after a night
of toil and excitement like this, than a mild and genuine Havannah.
Surely Nature would not be so lavish of her blessings, if it had not
been intended that we were to enjoy them in moderation.</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought so&mdash;no rest for the wicked,” continued he, starting up,
as the shrill pipe of the boatswain rose far above the noise of the
storm; “there it is! ‘All hands down top-gallant masts and yards!’
Finish your cigar, Mr Morton, and douce the glim when you have done. I
must be off.”</p>

<p>“I will go, too,” said Morton; “I am too much excited to sleep.”</p>

<p>The night was now pitch dark, the wind had increased to a strong gale,
and the ship was rolling “gunnels to,” in the long heavy sea; bright
flashes of lightning, every now and then, threw a momentary glare over
the gloomy heavens, and the thunder rolled in loud and long-continued
peals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you, Jem, what ’ud come of sailing on a Friday? and we
haven’t seen the end on’t yet,” said Bill Halliday, one of the men we
before mentioned, as he was running up the main rigging, and a flash of
lightning shewed him his messmate beside him.</p>

<p>“Oh, never say ‘die,’ while there’s a shot in the locker, Bill; we’ll
weather many a Friday’s sailing yet.”</p>

<p>Just then the ship gave a heavy lurch to windward; Jem heard a loud
and startling cry close beside him, and, looking downwards through the
darkness, a sudden flash shewed him his messmate struggling for life on
the surface of the water; he had slipped his foot, poor fellow, and,
amid the roar of the waters and the howling of the gale, the noise of
his plunge was unheard by those on deck. His messmate, trembling with
horror, raised the cry of “A man overboard!” but, alas! in vain; in
such a night and such a sea, it would have been madness to risk the
lives of the many for the one. The next flash lighted the sea far and
near, and all eyes were anxiously bent upon the water; but nothing was
visible but the dark heaving mass, with the white foam driving over its
surface; the ravenous waves had done their work quickly and mercifully.</p>

<p>Soon after this, as if satisfied with this sacrifice to its fury, the
gale began gradually to moderate; and, before next night, the ship was
again “all a-taunto,” and standing to the southward, with a leading
wind, under single-reefed topsails, and topgallantsails. The following
day, the weather was so fine, and the water so smooth, that the
ladies, who had not hitherto ventured out of their cabins, made their
appearance at the cuddy table. At dinner, Morton was seated nearly
opposite to a remarkably fine <em>turkey</em>, and his eyes were constantly
wandering in that direction, but whether for the purpose of admiring
<em>its</em> beauties, or those of a young lady seated behind it, it was
difficult to distinguish. His contemplation however, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> of the
dead or the living beauty, seemed to have diverted his thoughts from
the indulgence of his appetite.</p>

<p>“Mr Morton, a glass of wine?” said the captain; “you seem to be
contented with <em>looking</em> at that fine turkey.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful creature!” replied he.</p>

<p>“Won’t you send your plate over for some of it?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” sighed he, looking most languishingly in the
direction of the turkey.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr Morton,” said Hardy, “you said before dinner that you had an
excellent appetite; you are not giving proof of it now&mdash;I am afraid you
are not well.”</p>

<p>Morton coloured to the eyes, and gave a faint laugh. The fact was,
that he was <em>not</em> well; he had just been seized with a violent attack
of a rather uncommon complaint, called “love at first sight.” He felt
confused, he scarcely knew why, and he fancied everybody was noticing
his confusion, which made him ten times worse. He laughed when he ought
to have looked grave, and looked grave when he ought to have laughed,
and was guilty of a thousand awkwardnesses, which attracted towards him
the observation he wished to avoid. He strove manfully to look up the
table, and down the table, and in every direction but that in which
he wished to look; but his eyes would, somehow or another, have their
own way in spite of him, and always contrived, at last, as naturally
as possible, to direct their glances towards the neighbourhood of the
turkey. It was with a feeling of positive relief he saw the ladies
retire from the table; and no sooner were they gone than he became a
rational man again, though rather more abstracted and silent than he
had been before dinner.</p>

<p>“That was rather a nice-looking girl sitting opposite to me at dinner,”
remarked he, hesitatingly and inquiringly, to his friend Hardy, after
they rose from table. “Do you know who she is?”</p>

<p>“I have heard her name, but I forget it just now,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> the sailor;
“but she is a devilish fine woman; I wonder the captain did not
introduce you to her.”</p>

<p>“Why, so he did; but he spoke so indistinctly that I could not catch
the name.”</p>

<p>At one bell in the second dog-watch (half-past six), the band made
their appearance on deck; and no sooner were the lively strains of the
music heard, than the ship’s company, always ready for “a lark,” came
swarming up the hatchways, and the decks soon resounded with the sounds
of the “fantastic,” but anything but “light” toe.</p>

<p>“Come, gentlemen,” said Captain Dickens to his passengers, “won’t you
follow the good example the men are setting you? Can’t you persuade the
ladies to dance? Mr Morton, here is a fair lady for you to try your
powers of persuasion upon,” looking at one who was walking beside him,
and who made a movement of assent in reply to Morton’s bow.</p>

<p>It was the fair one who had attracted so much of his attention at
dinner. As the captain resigned her to his charge, Morton blushed,
and stammered, and wished himself a hundred miles off, although he
was in the very situation which, a few minutes before, he thought he
could give worlds to occupy. What fools does love make of wise men! At
last, the preliminaries were satisfactorily arranged, and the dance
commenced; and, before its conclusion, the partners were mutually
pleased with each other.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr Morton,” said the captain, “I hope you enjoyed your dance?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed,” replied he; “I hope you do not feel fatigued, Miss
Martyr.”</p>

<p>“Miss who?” said the captain, laughing; “you are surely not going to
make a <em>martyr</em> of your partner.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>“If I have made a mistake, Captain Dickens, you ought to make the
<em>amende honorable</em> for me, for you spoke so indistinctly that I
misunderstood you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be happy to make the only reparation in my power, by
re-introducing you clearly and distinctly to Miss Martin.”</p>

<p>Yes, Miss Martin&mdash;our old, and we hope not uninteresting friend, Jessie
Martin; and the scene of the introduction was the quarter-deck of
the <i>Lady Flora</i>. At eight o’clock, the band struck up “God save the
King,” and the party separated for the night&mdash;the ladies retiring to
their cabins, and the gentlemen adjourning to the cuddy, to discuss
their grog. For several successive nights, however, by some strange
coincidence, Morton always happened to be just making his appearance
at the top of the companion ladder, as Miss Martin was emerging from
the cuddy-door, to take her evening promenade. Of course, common
politeness required that he should offer his arm to support her,
because the ship had a good deal of motion, or because, if there were
none just then, there might be by and by. Jessie was much pleased with
her new acquaintance, when the first embarrassment of his manner wore
off. This she attributed to that kind of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</i> which a
man acquires from a life of seclusion, or from a limited intercourse
with society. Perfectly free from personal vanity, she had not the
most remote idea that it had any connection with her own attractions;
but she soon had cause to alter her opinion. She was surprised at
his varied and extensive store of knowledge, and delighted with his
lively and animated manner of imparting it. He had evidently mixed a
great deal in society, and his conversation abounded in amusing and
interesting anecdotes of celebrated characters whom it had been his
good fortune to have associated with. There was something particularly
gratifying to a mind like Jessie’s, in being selected as the friend
of one who appeared in every way so estimable; and his silent, yet
constant and brother-like attention to her comfort and wishes, excited
her feelings of grateful regard. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> they went on for some time
together, he becoming day after day more and more deeply enamoured, and
she unconsciously increasing his love for her, by the frank and natural
confidence of her manner towards him. At last, a hint from Mrs Jameson,
the lady under whose charge she had been placed, opened her eyes to
the danger and impropriety of so close an intimacy with one who, she
felt, was daily making rapid advances in her good opinion, and whose
increasing admiration of her was beginning to be but too evident. She
called to mind, what she blamed herself for having so long kept out
of view&mdash;her delicate position as the affianced bride of another, and
saw, in its true colours, the double treachery she would be guilty of
in further encouraging, or rather in not repelling, the attentions of
a new admirer. It was doing great violence to her feelings gradually
to withdraw from her companionship with Morton, particularly as she
must have been blind indeed not to remark the pain which her apparent
coldness inflicted upon him; but, when she had once made up her mind
as to the propriety of the course she had adopted, she steadily and
firmly persevered in it. Philip, surprised at the change in her manner,
wearied himself with conjectures as to its cause, and feared that some
inadvertent act or expression of his might have given her offence; but
it was in vain he taxed his memory; he could not recall any instance
in which his conscience could reproach him for having overstepped the
bounds of respectful and polite attention.</p>

<p>At last, no longer able to bear the pain of uncertainty, he resolved
at once boldly to venture on a step, upon the result of which he felt
that his future happiness depended. Mrs Jameson had long noticed
Morton’s growing love for Jessie, and, knowing the peculiar situation
in which her young protegé was placed, had, as we before remarked,
advised her to adopt a more distant carriage towards him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> but, at the
same time, charmed with Morton’s amiable and estimable character, and
feeling for the disappointment which awaited him, she herself redoubled
her attentions towards him. Emboldened by the kind interest of her
manner, Morton resolved on making her his confidante, and accordingly
revealed to her, that which she had, with woman’s quickness, long since
discovered&mdash;the secret of his love.</p>

<p>“I have long feared this, Mr Morton,” replied she; “feared it, because
I feel the greatest interest in you, and because I know that there
exists an insuperable obstacle to the fulfilment of your hopes.”</p>

<p>“Insuperable! do not say insuperable, Mrs Jameson! I know that the
shortness of my acquaintance with Miss Martin hardly warrants my
presuming to address her; but will not time and the most devoted
attachment work a change in my favour? Oh, let me see her! let me plead
my own cause before her, and, if unsuccessfully, let me at least have
the melancholy satisfaction of hearing my sentence from her own lips?”</p>

<p>“An interview would only be distressing to you both, Mr Morton. I
am not at liberty to say more; but I know that the result will be
unfavourable to your wishes.”</p>

<p>Morton’s importunity, however, prevailed; the kind-hearted friend,
melted by the sight of his distress, promised to procure him a private
interview with Miss Martin. Great was Jessie’s agitation when she
received Mrs Jameson’s communication. She had resolutely and firmly
avoided meeting Morton, ever since her eyes had been opened to the
nature of her feelings towards him, which she considered it her bounden
duty to repress, as a proper sacrifice to principle; but the struggle
was a severe one&mdash;the arrow rankled deeper than she suspected. She was
sitting alone, when Morton, by Mrs Jameson’s invitation, entered the
cabin. A crimson flush overspread her cheek, which as quickly left
it again. She was looking very pale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> received him with visible
agitation. It was in a tremulous and low tone of voice, that Morton
first began to address her; but, as he proceeded, his countenance
glowed, and his words followed each other in such a rapid and fervent
torrent, that she in vain attempted to interrupt him. He described
the impression her first appearance had made upon his heart, the
charm he had experienced in her society, and the gradual, yet rapid
growth of his admiration and esteem upon a closer acquaintance with
her character. He dwelt long and deeply upon the grief her apparent
estrangement had occasioned him, begged her to forgive him if he had in
any way given her cause of offence, explained to her his circumstances
and views in life, and ended by laying his heart and fortune at her
feet.</p>

<p>“Mr Morton,” replied she, “I would fain have spared myself and you the
pain of this meeting; but I owed it to you, to make some reparation for
the error into which I have unfortunately led you; otherwise, I would
have deputed my friend to take upon her a duty so distressing to my own
feelings. Severely do I now blame myself for having so inconsiderately
indulged in the pleasure which your society afforded me. I mistook your
feelings. I looked upon you as a friend, and I forgot how near akin
friendship is to love. Forgive me, Mr Morton!&mdash;I never can be yours&mdash;I
am the affianced bride of another.”</p>

<p>“Affianced!” exclaimed Morton, pressing his hand upon his brow, and
absolutely gasping with oppression of feelings. “O heaven! I did not
expect this, Miss Martin. But is your heart in the engagement?”</p>

<p>Jessie burst into tears. “Urge me no farther, Mr Morton&mdash;my fate is
in the hands of another. Henceforth, we must be as strangers to each
other&mdash;Adieu!” And she glided into an inner apartment. Morton gazed
after her for a moment, and then with a heavy heart left the cabin.
His friend Hardy found him sitting, with his face buried in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> hands
upon the table, and eagerly and affectionately inquired the cause of
his distress. Morton related to him all that had passed, and ended with
saying&mdash;“And now, there is no more happiness for me in this world.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” said his friend, “I give you joy.”</p>

<p>“Give me joy, Hardy! I did not expect this from you! Instead of
sympathising with me, you rejoice in my disappointment!”</p>

<p>“I rejoice, but not in your disappointment. Mark my words, Morton! The
girl loves you, and, though at present, appearances are against you,
do not be downcast&mdash;many a more broken boat has reached the land. If
my suspicions are correct, depend upon it, a girl of Miss Martin’s
principles will not be guilty of the treachery of deceiving the man who
claims her hand, into the belief that he possesses her heart.”</p>

<p>During the remainder of the voyage, Jessie strictly adhered to her
resolution, and Philip had too much respect for the woman he loved,
to endeavour to shake it. It was soon evident to Mrs Jameson, who
sincerely sympathised with him, that he was not the only sufferer;
but that it was a grievous trial to them both; and, while she truly
pitied them both, she could not but admire and respect the high sense
of principle by which they were mutually actuated. The thought of
the approaching termination of the voyage, which was by all else on
board looked forward to with delight, was to them like the haunting
recollection of a frightful dream, which they strove to drive from
their minds; for, unhappy as they now were, it was bliss compared to
the thought of being separated for ever. At length, the high land
about Ganjam was seen from the masthead, and, two days afterwards, a
strange sail hove in sight, which, on a nearer approach, proved to
be a brig, with the pilot flag fluttering aloft. “All hands shorten
sail!” was soon the cry, and “Up there, topmen!” In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> a few minutes,
the lofty canvass was taken in, and the active topmen were busily
employed in rolling it up; while the <i>Lady Flora</i>, with her maintopsail
to the mast, scarcely moved through the water, as she gracefully
rose and fell, or, as a popular authoress expresses it, “curtseyed,”
as if saluting the approaching stranger, which shortened sail as
she came near, and rounded to on the opposite tack. A double-banked
boat, manned with Lascars, shoved off from the brig, and the pilot
soon made his appearance on board. The purser of the <i>Flora</i>, with
letters and despatches for Calcutta, returned in the boat to the
brig, which immediately made all sail for Kedgeree; and the <i>Lady
Flora</i>, under easy canvass, followed at a distance in her wake. In
the evening, the ship was brought to an anchor, at which time the
brig was, lower masts down, a-head. Next morning, the <i>Flora</i> got
under way, and was soon snug at anchor off Kedgeree, where she was
to discharge some of her cargo, before proceeding up the river. In
the meantime, her letters had been forwarded by “dawk” to Calcutta.
In three days’ time, a schooner-rigged budgerow was seen coming down
the river, which anchored inshore of the <i>Flora</i>, and hailed her
for a boat. A cutter was immediately despatched to her, which soon
returned with a stranger sitting in the stern sheets. Jessie Martin
had been sadly and listlessly employed, all the morning, in making
preparations for landing, arranging, and directing her trunks; but
her work proceeded slowly; for, in spite of her better reason, her
thoughts dwelt mournfully on her approaching separation from Morton,
when a knock was heard at the cabin door, and, as if to reproach her
with her inconstancy, the lover of her youth stood before her. Jessie
had, for months, been anticipating with dread, her meeting with Edward
Malcolmson, and had, as she thought, nerved herself to go through
the trial with firmness; but, now it had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> upon her, she was
taken unawares. The surprise was too great for her; she felt a mortal
sickness creeping over her, and, turning deadly-pale, fell fainting
into her chair. Malcolmson ran to her assistance, and, sprinkling some
water on her forehead, restored her to consciousness, when she hid her
face in her hands, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Jessie,” said Malcolmson, surprised at her agitation, “this is an
unexpected reception. Am I an object of dread to you? I came here,
ready and willing to fulfil my promise, and to claim you as my bride,
and you seem to shrink from me, as if I were hateful in your sight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!&mdash;not hateful, Edward. My heart owns you as an old and dear
friend. There,” said she, putting her hand into his, “there is the hand
I promised you! But, as it is to be so, would that we had never parted!”</p>

<p>“What do I hear?” said he, in a tone which surprised her; “you say,
here is my hand! Is your heart not with it, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“Edward,” answered she, “this is no time for dissimulation. We are
about to take a step on which our happiness or misery for life depends.
You will despise me, Edward, but I dare not deceive you. My hand is
yours, if you desire it; but my heart is another’s.” And, thus saying,
she looked fearfully in his face, to see what effect her confession
would have upon him. To her great surprise, a flush of gratification
spread over his countenance, and he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>“Heaven be praised! O Jessie, what a load of unhappiness you have
removed from my heart! But why did you not write to me? Why did you not
tell me of the change in your sentiments? And you have been dreading
to meet me! and I have been equally alarmed at the thoughts of meeting
you! How ridiculous! Two old lovers acting bugbear to each other! There
is one comfort, however, Jessie, the one cannot rail at the other for
inconstancy; for I have been playing truant as well as yourself.
But who is the happy man who has supplanted me in your affections? I
sincerely trust that he is worthy of you.”</p>

<p>“You may have an opportunity of judging for yourself, ere long,”
replied she, smiling; “but I will call my friend Mrs Jameson, to
you&mdash;she will explain all.”</p>

<p>She then sent for Mrs Jameson, and, having introduced her to
Malcolmson, and briefly stated how matters stood between them, left
them alone together.</p>

<p>Mrs Jameson gave Malcolmson a full account of all that had taken place
on board, spoke with enthusiastic admiration of the struggle, in both
the lovers, between “passion and principle,” and ended with saying that
she considered Jessie a fortunate woman to have gained the affection of
so amiable and estimable a man.</p>

<p>“But where is he? You must introduce me to him. I will go and bring him
to you. I daresay I shall find him somewhere on deck.” And away he went
in search of him. The deck was strewed with passengers’ luggage, and a
young and handsome man was moving about among it, apparently selecting
his own.</p>

<p>“I think this be one of your trunks, Mr Morton,” said one of the men to
him.</p>

<p>“Ah, there’s my man!” said Malcolmson. “Pray, sir, is your name Morton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is. May I beg, in return, to know whom I have the
pleasure of addressing?”</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> name, sir, is Malcolmson; yours is familiar to my ear, as that of
the guardian of a near relative whom I have never had the pleasure of
meeting. Pray, Mr Morton, are you Irish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>“Yes; but Morton is an adopted name&mdash;that of a kind relative and
benefactor. My own name is Denby, Philip Denby.”</p>

<p>“Gracious Powers! my brother! I am Edward Malcolmson, the son of your
mother. But come with me into Miss Martin’s cabin.”</p>

<p>And Philip followed him, dreading that in his brother he had met his
happy rival.</p>

<p>“Philip,” said his brother, “how shall we commemorate this happy
meeting? I must give you some memento to recall it to your
recollection. Here,” said he, taking Jessie’s hand in his own, “this
little hand is mine. I know you will prize it; so I make over my claim
to you, if you can prevail upon Jessie to consent to the change of
owners.”</p>

<p>Need we say that that consent was granted? The lovers were united;
and their example was soon followed by Edward Malcolmson and the fair
object of his affections, who afterwards accompanied Morton and his
bride home, to cheer their mother with the sight of the happy reunion
of her family.</p>

<h2>THE HAWICK SPATE.</h2>


<p>The bursting of water-spouts is a phenomenon not often witnessed in
Scotland; yet that such an accident has sometimes happened there, there
are not a few melancholy tales to prove; and to this testimony we could
add the story with which the following pages are occupied.</p>

<p>About the close of the seventeenth century, the town of Hawick
was visited with such a calamity as that just spoken of, although
we believe it was not attended with any singularly disastrous
consequences. The water-spout which burst over the town, on the
occasion alluded to, was of such immense magnitude, that the deluge of
waters it discharged filled the main street in an instant from side to
side, to the depth of from four to five feet. But it did not remain
long here. The inclination of the street gave it motion, and away it
swept with the force and impetuosity of a swollen river, carrying
everything before it; and in its furious career razing no fewer than
fifteen houses to their foundations.</p>

<p>Yet, if it had not been for the danger with which it was attended, and
the loss which it occasioned, an onlooker, if placed in a situation of
safety himself, could not possibly help being amazed, nay, sometimes
laughing outright, at the ludicrous scenes which such an unusual and
unlooked for visitor as the water occasioned; and particularly at the
odd display of floating objects of all kinds that were hurrying along
on the bosom of the impetuous stream; and which, from their utter
unfitness, in most cases, for such aquatic feats as they had been thus
suddenly called on to perform, presented a very laughable appearance.
There were chairs, tables, baskets, beds, stools, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&mdash;sometimes
in whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> fleets, sometimes in detached squadrons&mdash;all scudding along,
and apparently rivalling each other in speed, as if rejoicing in this
new power of locomotion. Now, the basket might be seen giving the “go
by” to the stool, and now the stool to the basket. Here might be seen a
table, neck and neck with a window shutter; and there an envious chaff
bed doing its best to make up with a hamper of greens, which having got
into a rapid current, was bidding defiance to competition, and looking
with most profound contempt on the unavailing efforts of its pursuers.
All this, a lively imagination would discover in the march of the
“Hawick Spate,” as the inundation of which we speak was called.</p>

<p>But all the objects that floated down this heaven-descended stream,
were not of the same ludicrous or uninteresting character with those
enumerated. There was, at any rate, one exception, and one calculated
to excite very different feelings in the beholder from those alluded
to. This object was a cradle; and it was tenanted. A little mariner,
unconscious of his danger, was on board the frail bark. Borne on by
the current, the cradle swept rapidly along, unobserved by any one;
for all were too intent on seeking their own personal safety, or on
saving their property, to pay any attention to the concerns of others;
or, if the cradle was seen, there was no one who would venture into
the rushing torrent to rescue the little voyager from the apparently
inevitable fate which awaited him. On, onward, the cradle sailed on the
bosom of the stream, now wheeling rapidly round in the eddies created
by sudden obstructions, and now shooting along like an arrow with the
liberated waters.</p>

<p>But all is not lost that’s in danger. In a secluded spot at a short
distance from the town, there happened to be, at the moment of which
we speak, one of those gipsy encampments which, though still to be
met with occasionally, are now more rare than they were then. This
encampment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> situated on one of the sloping sides of a deep hollow
or ravine; and it so chanced that this was precisely the course which
the waters took that rushed from the town; and thus everything which
was borne along with them, and that had not been previously stranded,
or otherwise arrested in its progress, floated past the bivouac of
the gipsies&mdash;but, observe, past only, if they thought them not worth
capturing; for the gipsies, with all the ready tact of their calling,
in making the most of circumstances, had instantly bethought them of
turning the present calamity to good account, by securing everything
they could lay their hands upon; and in the end their booty was far
from being inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Ranged along the edge of the stream, the gipsies, old and young,
male and female, might have been seen at this moment, eagerly and
busily employed, with long sticks, fishing in such articles as came
within their reach. Some of their number, however, more daring or
more greedy of spoil, might also have been seen far advanced into
the water, pursuing, at the imminent risk of their lives, the same
profitable pastime. It was while they were thus employed, that our
little mariner and his bark came in sight of the gipsies. A general cry
of surprise&mdash;not unmingled with compassion, at least on the part of
the female members of the gang&mdash;burst from them when the cradle hove
in sight, as they concluded that it was more than probable that it
contained a child.</p>

<p>“Save the infant! save the infant!” exclaimed several of the women
at once. But this was much easier said than done; for the cradle was
floating down the very centre of the stream, which, though now a good
deal diffused, and thus rendered shallower, was yet at least from four
to five feet deep in the middle; and, besides this, the bottom was
irregular, and interspersed with partial hollows, some of which would
have taken the tallest man in the gang over the head. Aware of this,
there was an evident hesitation on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> part of the men to incur the
risk of seizing the cradle although there were two motives to induce
them to the attempt. The one was humanity&mdash;the other, a much less
creditable one, interest; a child being at all times an acquisition to
a gipsy gang, for the purpose of exciting charity.</p>

<p>Which of these two motives was the stronger on this occasion, we will
not say; but certain it is, that there was an anxious desire on the
part of all to save the infant which was presumed to be in the cradle.</p>

<p>One of the most eager for the accomplishment of this humane purpose,
among the females of the gang, was a stout, masculine woman of the name
of Jean Gordon, who hastily <em>kilting</em> up her petticoats, dashed into
the stream when the cradle came in sight, with the view of intercepting
it; but the water was too deep for her, and she was obliged to stop
short long before she reached the line of the cradle’s direction.
Finding this, and highly excited by disappointment and anxiety, she
frantically called on some of the men to try and effect the rescue of
the child.</p>

<p>“John Young! John Young! save the wean!&mdash;save the wean!” she exclaimed,
addressing herself to a tall athletic man, who was the farthest out in
the stream, and who was at the moment busily employed in endeavouring
to secure a chest of drawers which were in the act of tumbling past
him. “I’m sure I’ve seen ye do baulder things than that, John, and for
far less. O man, for the love o’ God, and yer ain soul, save the puir
innocent!” For it had now been ascertained that there actually was a
child in the cradle.</p>

<p>The man thus appealed to by Jean made no reply, but steadily eyed for a
moment the approaching object of her solicitude, to which he was now at
liberty to pay attention, as the chest of drawers had fairly got out of
his reach. The cradle, in the meantime, came gliding rapidly onwards;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
but it was evident that it would pass at the distance of several yards
from where Young stood.</p>

<p>Young, who was an excellent and a fearless swimmer, marked this, and
took his measures accordingly; for he had determined on making an
effort to save the infant. Having waded in to the shoulders, he waited
till the cradle had arrived within a few feet of the line on which
he stood, when he made a bold and sudden push into the centre of the
stream, and so well calculated his distance, that, after making a few
strokes&mdash;for he had lost his footing&mdash;he came in contact with it at the
exact point on which he had reckoned. Seizing now the cradle with one
hand, and keeping himself afloat with the other, Young prudently gave
way to the current, and allowed himself to be borne along with it until
an opportunity should present itself for his striking in for the shore.
The situation of Young, however, was a perilous one; but he did not
want the stimulus of approbation to enable him to go through with his
humane purpose. Jean Gordon ran along the margin of the stream, keeping
up with the floating, rather than swimming man, and anon raising her
voice with these words of encouragement.</p>

<p>“That’s my brave man!” she shouted, as she dashed through hedge and
bush in her onward progress, with her eye fixed on the cradle, and
regardless of all obstructions that lay in her path. “That’s my brave
man! Haud on, John&mdash;haud on! Never mind the ragin o’ the waters, John,
but be o’ stout heart; for the Lord’s wi’ ye, and ’ll bear ye up wi’ a
strong arm. This way noo, John&mdash;this way noo,” she added, pointing to
a small inlet where there was no current, and which promised an easy
landing-place. “This way, John,” she said, and dashed into the water to
assist the voyagers to land.</p>

<p>Young, approving of Jean’s suggestion, made a strong effort to free
himself from the current, and succeeded in getting into the still and
shallow water, where he quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> gained his feet; Jean, at the same
moment, pouncing on the child, which she took from the cradle and
hugged to her bosom in a rapture of joy.</p>

<p>“Faith, it was a teuch job, Jean,” said Young, now shaking himself like
a huge water-dog; “but it’s a guid ane, and I houp ’ll stan’ against
twa or throe o’ my sins.”</p>

<p>“Nae doot o’t, John&mdash;nae doot o’t,” replied Jean, gazing fondly on the
infant as she spoke. “It’s a guid deed, and will be remembered to yer
advantage baith here and hereafter. A bonny bairn it is, in troth,”
she went on, now apostrophizing the infant; “and ’ll be sair missed by
somebody, I warrant.”</p>

<p>Having said this, she wrapped up the child in the blankets in which it
had been enveloped in the cradle, and, accompanied by Young, returned
to the encampment, which they found breaking up, and the gang hurriedly
preparing to depart&mdash;a sudden move, indeed, but one for which there
was good reason. The gipsies had rescued a number of things from
the water, which it was certain their owners would miss, and which,
therefore, it was not improbable they might institute some troublesome
inquiries after, if they remained much longer where they were; and it
was thought best to avoid this annoyance by decamping. Urged on by
these considerations, the packing up was soon completed; and, in a very
few minutes, the whole troop was on the march towards Yetholm, in the
neighbourhood of which they again pitched their tents.</p>

<p>Our story does not require, neither would it be in the least
interesting, to follow any further the subsequent wanderings of the
erratic tribe to which we have introduced the reader; nor would it
afford any entertainment to trace the infant years of the little one
whom they had rescued from the flood. It is enough to say that he
grew up, under the maternal care and tendance of Jean Gordon&mdash;who had
especially attached herself to him&mdash;a stout and active lad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> bearing
the name of his foster-mother, which had been conferred upon him by the
general consent of the gang, in consequence of their mutual attachment.</p>

<p>Young Gordon&mdash;the name by which we will now designate the little hero
of the “Hawick Spate” evinced, at a very early period, a singularly
bold and daring disposition; which, added to great physical strength,
and a restless and enterprising spirit, promised, in due time, to place
him at the head of the little community to which he belonged. But,
though a wild and somewhat reckless character, young Gordon was not
without some redeeming qualities. Gipsy though he was, he had a dash of
honour and good feeling about him; and would, at any time, as soon do
a good thing as a bad&mdash;perhaps sooner. In truth, all that was evil in
him might have been fairly traced to the circumstances in which he was
placed; while, whatever was good might, with equal truth and justice,
have been attributed to his original nature.</p>

<p>Such, then, was Gordon in his twentieth year, for to this age had he
attained when we resume our story.</p>

<p>As the gang to which Gordon belonged, was, one day, at this period,
migrating from one place to another, they met an Irish regiment on its
march to Stirling, to join the forces there assembled under the Duke
of Argyle, who was preparing to march against the Earl of Mar, then in
arms for the exiled family of Stuart.</p>

<p>Gordon, who had never seen an entire regiment before, was captivated
with the warlike appearance it presented; and was suddenly struck with
the desire of becoming a soldier&mdash;a desire which, in accordance with
the impetuosity of his nature, he resolved instantly to gratify. With
this view, but concealing his movements from his associates, he made up
to a sergeant, and offered himself as a recruit. The sergeant, after
eying him for a moment, and jading him, as he said, “a likely fellow,”
very gladly accepted his offer, and at once enlisted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Gordon, having thus secured the object of his wishes, asked permission
to take leave of his friends before marching away with the regiment&mdash;a
request which was at once granted, on the condition that he should be
accompanied by a couple of soldiers, to insure his return. On joining
his former associates, he informed them of the step he had taken, and
added, that he had now come to bid them farewell. The intelligence
struck them all with surprise and regret; for he was a general
favourite, and, indeed, had now become the chief hope of the erratic
family. But there was none among them who felt so much on this occasion
as Jean Gordon.</p>

<p>On hearing of the step her adopted son had taken, she gave way to the
most poignant grief.</p>

<p>“Oh, my bairn! my bairn!” she cried, “are ye gaun to leave me? Can ye
hae the heart to desert her wha has carried ye in her arms through
frost and snaw, through wind and weet&mdash;frae the time ye was a cradled
wean till ye was able to tak the road yersel&mdash;wha has tended ye nicht
an’ day, wi’ a mother’s care, frae that time till this hoor&mdash;and wha
has mony and aft the time sheltered ye in her bosom frae the biting
blast which was like to cut short the thread o’ her ain life? Ay, warm
and dry hae I aften keepit ye then, when I was mysel’ perishin wi’
baith hunger and cauld, nane o’ whilk, I trow, e’er came near ye. But
ye shanna gang wi’ the redcoats, Gordon,” she added, with a determined
air; “rather than ye should do that, I’ll tell the haill secret we hae
a’ keepit sae lang, although it should bring every ane o’ us to the
gibbet&mdash;and that’ll prevent ye gaun, I jalouse.”</p>

<p>“That ye won’t, old devil,” here chimed in a ferocious-looking member
of the gang. “We’ll tak care o’ that. Ye ken we hae a way o’ disposing
o’ tell-tales, Jean; and, if ye talk o’ peaching, ye shall hae a taste
o’t, I warrant.”</p>

<p>To this threat Jean made no reply, and probably she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> would have
entirely disregarded it, had there been no other inducement for her to
keep silence on the subject she hinted at. But other inducements there
were. Had she divulged the secret to which she alluded, and which was
no other than that of Gordon’s real parentage, she would have exposed
two brothers and a husband to the vengeance of the law&mdash;and this
consideration at once checked the resolution she had begun to entertain.</p>

<p>To return to our story. Jean’s expostulations with Gordon on the step
he had taken, and her appeals to his gratitude, in behalf of her wish
to induce him to remain with her, were not unheeded by the young man,
who readily acknowledged, with a tear in his eye while he spoke, all
her kindnesses to him. But it was now too late. The deed was done, and
there was no recalling it; neither, it must be confessed, did Gordon
wish it should be recalled.</p>

<p>We have said that there was none of the little community to which
Gordon belonged, who felt so much at the prospect of his leaving them
as Jean; but this was not strictly correct. There was another who felt
even more than she did; although these feelings were not, in every
particular, of precisely the same description. That other person was
Jean’s daughter&mdash;a little black-eyed gipsy of about eighteen years of
age, and between whom and Gordon there had long subsisted a mutual
attachment.</p>

<p>On learning of the sudden step which her lover had taken, the poor girl
wept bitterly, and was not consoled until Gordon had repeatedly and
solemnly assured her of a continuance of his love, and that he would
very soon return to her&mdash;“When,” he said&mdash;but this sentence he finished
in a whisper into her ear&mdash;“you shall become my wife, Rosie.”</p>

<p>The gipsy girl held down her head and blushed. Gordon flung his
arms around her neck&mdash;tenderly embraced her&mdash;and, in a few minutes
afterwards, was on the march with his regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few days after the arrival of the latter at Stirling, the Duke
of Argyle, having learned that the Earl of Mar was approaching, with
the view of giving him battle, mustered his army, which included the
regiment to which Gordon belonged, and marched out to meet him. The
opposing armies came in sight of each other on Sheriffmuir, where, as
is well known, a pretty severe encounter took place, in which both
sides claimed the victory. In this engagement, the regiment in which
Gordon served was stationed on the left wing of the royal forces, which
was opposed to the Highlanders in Mar’s army, and thus involved in the
most sanguinary part of the conflict.</p>

<p>Soon after the commencement of the battle, our young soldier was
fortunate enough to save the life of an officer of the King’s army.
This officer, who was mounted, was unhorsed by a Highlander, who had
previously wounded him severely in the thigh with his broadsword, and
was about to complete his destruction with the same weapon as he lay
defenceless on the ground, when Gordon ran him through the heart with
his bayonet. In the next instant, and before the person whose life
Gordon had saved, could inform him who he was, or thank him for his
opportune and very effective aid, the tide of battle rolled over the
spot, and they were separated. Nor did they meet again&mdash;and thus each
remained in ignorance of who the other was.</p>

<p>It was not long after this, however, before Gordon himself required the
aid which he had so timeously afforded another, and that under nearly
similar circumstances. He was attacked by a ferocious mountaineer of
immense stature, who made a cut at him with his broadsword; but Gordon
not only adroitly warded off the blow with his musket, but succeeded
in inflicting a deep wound on his antagonist with his bayonet. Enraged
to find himself thus baffled by a stripling, and smarting with pain,
the infuriated Celt beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> down Gordon’s firelock, and rushed in upon
him, with the intention of dispatching him with his dirk. But this was
not so easily done. Finding his musket no longer of any avail, Gordon
dropped it on the ground, and, quick as lightning, sprang upon and
grappled with his enemy; and thus, in turn, prevented him making use of
his weapons. A desperate struggle now ensued between the combatants,
each endeavouring to overturn the other; and, for a moment or two,
it was doubtful which would eventually be thrown. But the superior
strength of the Highlander finally prevailed, and Gordon fell, with his
remorseless foe above him. In the next instant, the Highlander’s dirk
gleamed in the air, and was already on its descent towards the heart
of the prostrate youth, when, ere the blow could be struck, both the
weapon and the hand which held it fell to the ground. The arm of the
Highlander had been severed, at this critical moment, by the sabre of a
dragoon, who had approached the combatants unperceived by either. Thus
miraculously freed from the danger of immediate death, Gordon sprang to
his feet, and assisted the trooper in completing the destruction of his
assailant, whom they instantly despatched. But the perils of the day to
the young soldier did not terminate with this adventure; another soon
after befell him, that threatened to end more fatally.</p>

<p>When making his way back to join his regiment, which had shifted its
ground in the tumult of fight, he suddenly found himself intercepted by
a party of the enemy, by whom he was taken prisoner, and immediately
after disarmed, bound, and sent to the rear, where he found several
others in the same unhappy situation with himself. On the termination
of the conflict, the prisoners were marched to a small village, at the
distance of eight or ten miles from the field of battle; and, on the
following day, a kind of court-martial, formed of a few straggling
officers hastily brought together, was held on them, when, after a
trial which lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> only a few minutes, the whole were condemned to
death, for being in arms&mdash;so ran the words of their doom&mdash;against their
lawful king, James VII.; and the hour of two in the afternoon, of the
same day, was appointed for carrying the sentence into effect.</p>

<p>The unfortunate men were now remanded to the several apartments in
which they had been confined previous to their trial, and recommended
to pass the short time they had to live in making their peace with God.</p>

<p>In the meantime a rude gibbet was hastily erected; and, at the
appointed hour, the prisoners, and amongst these, Gordon, were marched
to the place of execution, surrounded by a strong party of troopers.
Dreadful as was his situation, however, young Gordon blenched not. His
bearing was manly; and, in that fearful hour, his indomitable spirit
enabled him to contemplate his approaching death with the calmness and
resolution of a martyr. There was but one thought that unmanned him in
this trying hour, when he allowed his imagination to dwell on it. This
thought was of his Rosie, the object of his heart’s fondest affections.
But he checked the enervating reflection, and prepared to meet his doom
with becoming fortitude.</p>

<p>The preparations for the tragical scene being completed, the prisoners
were brought forward, and tied up, one after the other, to the fatal
beam. Everything being now in readiness, the signal was about to be
given which would have closed the world on the unfortunate men for
ever, when all at once a loud and confused cry arose that the enemy
was approaching. In an instant the gibbet was deserted by the troopers
who surrounded it, who galloped off wildly in all directions in utter
ignorance of the quarter from which the threatened danger was coming.</p>

<p>Gordon, whose presence of mind had never for a moment forsaken him,
perceiving the opportunity for escape which thus so unexpectedly
presented itself, instantly took advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> of it. Having hurriedly
desired the brother in misfortune who stood next him to unloose the
rope with which his arms were bound, he freed himself from the noose
which was about his neck, and, with the rapidity of thought, drew
from his pocket a large clasp knife, and cut the bands by which his
fellow-prisoners were pinioned, and set them all at liberty. Having
effected this generous purpose, Gordon leaped to the ground, and
called out that every one should now endeavour to save himself&mdash;a
recommendation which it will readily be believed was very soon attended
to.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the troopers having discovered that they had
been frightened by a false alarm, which, indeed, it had been, hastened
back to carry the sentence of the prisoners into effect; when, finding
that they had made their escape, they commenced a furious pursuit,
and succeeded in overtaking several of the unfortunate men, whom they
instantly cut down&mdash;adopting this summary procedure in preference to
the more tedious and troublesome one of carrying them back to the
gibbet.</p>

<p>Gordon, who had by this time gained a rising ground, where he had
thrown himself down breathless and exhausted, saw this prompt execution
done on two or three of the fugitives; and, in dread of sharing a
similar fate, again started to his feet, and resumed his flight.</p>

<p>But this movement threatened to have been fatal to him. He was
perceived by two troopers, who immediately gave chase after him; and,
as the height which he had taken, though pretty steep, was free from
any obstruction which could arrest the progress of horsemen, they
gained fast upon, him. Poor Gordon now gave himself up for lost, and
thought that he had but escaped the halter to perish by the sword.
Still, however, he struggled on; but his pursuers, continuing to
gain on him, were soon so near that he could distinctly hear the
abusive epithets and deep curses in which they at once expressed their
impatience, the length of the chase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> and their eagerness to accomplish
the destruction of him who caused it. A few minutes more, without
the intervention of some fortunate circumstance, and Gordon would
have been under the sabres of his pursuers; but such a circumstance
did at this moment interpose, and he was once more saved from a fate
that seemed inevitable. A ledge of rock impassable to horsemen, but
easily accessible by a person on foot, suddenly presented itself. For
this place of safety Gordon made with all possible speed, and with a
desperate effort quickly gained a sufficient height to defy further
pursuit from the troopers. But although he was out of the reach of
their swords, he had not the same security from their bullets; and
this he soon found. Two shots were fired at him by his pursuers, and
both hit the rock so close by his head, that some of the splinters
struck him in the face, and wounded him pretty severely. The aim of the
troopers had been so well taken, that Gordon had no doubt, if they got
another round at him, that he would be brought down; but, fortunately,
he was able to clear the summit of the ledge before they had time to
reload, and was thus secure, for a time at least, from all further
danger from his pursuers.</p>

<p>Although now dreadfully exhausted, Gordon continued his flight until
he became so worn out that he found it impossible to proceed. When
reduced to this extremity, he crawled into a retired field that lay
at some distance from any road, and flung himself at fall length
behind a low wall by which it was intersected. Here he soon fell into
a profound sleep, in which all the dangers he had passed, and all the
perils to which he might yet be exposed, were for a time forgotten. In
this situation, however, he had not remained above an hour, when he
was awakened by some one shaking him by the shoulder. He started to
his feet in the utmost alarm, having no doubt that it was an enemy who
had discovered his retreat, but was soon relieved from his fears by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
perceiving a person in the dress of a shepherd standing before him.</p>

<p>“Whar hae ye come frae, honest lad?” said the man, in a kindly voice,
and with an expression of sympathy in his countenance, excited by the
fatigued and haggard appearance of the young man.</p>

<p>“From the Borders,” replied Gordon, not caring to come to particulars
with a stranger in such troublesome times, and uncertain what treatment
he might meet with by claiming connection with either of the contending
parties between whom the kingdom was then divided.</p>

<p>“I’m jalousin,” said the stranger, with an expressive smile, as he
eyed some of the fragments of military costume which were still about
Gordon’s person&mdash;“I am jalousin that ye hae been <em>oot</em>, young man.
Do ye ken a place they ca’ Shirramuir?” he added, with a knowing,
but good-humoured look, which at once induced Gordon not only to
acknowledge that he did, but to tell him his precise situation,
together with all that had lately befallen him.</p>

<p>“Aweel, aweel, freen,” said the man, when Gordon had concluded&mdash;“It’s
a’ the same to me what side ye war on, for I carena a sheep’s head for
ony o’ them. Sae, ye’ll come alang wi’ me, an’ I’ll gie ye a nicht’s
quarters, and some refreshment, o’ whilk ye seem to me to staun muckle
in need; for, in troth, lad, ye are sair forfochten like.”</p>

<p>Having said this, the kind-hearted shepherd conducted Gordon to his
house, which was close at hand, and gave him all the entertainment he
had so generously promised. Here Gordon remained all night; and, on the
following morning, prepared for his departure, having now resolved to
return to his old friends, the gipsies.</p>

<p>Previous to his setting out, his kind host suggested that he should
strip himself of everything about his apparel that might discover
the side to which he had belonged&mdash;a suggestion with which Gordon
immediately complied; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> his entertainer supplied the deficiencies
thus occasioned, by presenting him with a shepherd’s plaid and bonnet,
to which he added a small sum of money.</p>

<p>Thus provided, refreshed, and, we may add, disguised, Gordon took
the road, and on the third day thereafter, arrived in safety at the
encampment of his old friends, which, knowing their haunts, he had no
difficulty in finding.</p>

<p>The joy of the whole gang, and particularly of Jean and her daughter,
on seeing him so soon again, was excessive. Jean hugged him to her
bosom, and in a rapture of delight, poured out upon him a torrent
of the most endearing epithets; while her daughter, though not less
overjoyed, sought, with maidenly modesty, to conceal the happiness she
felt. But it would not hide. The smile and the tear which she could not
suppress, betrayed the secret of her feelings. This excitement over on
all sides, Gordon gradually fell into his former position in the little
community, and resumed the habits and wandering life which his short,
but eventful military career had interrupted; and in this way time ran
on until other three or four years had elapsed.</p>

<p>About the end of this period, as Gordon, with two or three more of
his associates, was one day passing through Jedburgh, where there
was, at the time, a recruiting party stationed, two soldiers, after
looking earnestly at him for some minutes, suddenly made up to him, and
asked if his name was not Gordon, and if he had not once belonged to
the &mdash;&mdash; Regiment of Foot. To both of these questions Gordon at once
replied in the affirmative, not being aware that he had any reason to
do otherwise; for it had never occurred to him that, by not rejoining
his regiment after the battle of Sheriffmuir, he had rendered himself
liable to a charge of desertion; still less did he think that he had
actually been all this time a deserter. But so it certainly was; and so
he now found it to be.</p>

<p>“Then,” said one of the soldiers, on his acknowledging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> both
circumstances, “you come along with, us, my lad; you are our prisoner.”
And both the men drew their side-arms to make good their capture.</p>

<p>Gordon was now carried to the quarters of the commanding officer of
the recruiting party, and by him was immediately sent off, escorted by
three soldiers, to Edinburgh Castle, to stand trial for desertion from
his Majesty’s service.</p>

<p>In a few days after his arrival there, a court-martial was summoned,
when Gordon’s identity, and the facts of his enlistment and desertion
having been proven, he was condemned to be shot&mdash;the utmost penalty
of military law having been adjudged him, as the desertion had taken
place in time of war, and at a period when fidelity was most especially
required.</p>

<p>Thus was poor Gordon twice exposed to the horrors of a violent death
by judicial sentence; but still his natural courage did not fail him.
He again boldly prepared to meet the fate which seemed determined to
overtake him, and which now certainly seemed quite inevitable, as there
was not the slightest chance of any circumstance occurring in this case
to avert it.</p>

<p>The place selected for the impending tragedy was the Portobello Sands;
and thither the unfortunate culprit, accompanied by the whole garrison,
was conveyed on the day appointed for his execution.</p>

<p>Amongst the official persons of note who were present on this
melancholy occasion was the Duke of Argyle, who had arrived in
Edinburgh on the preceding day; and who, as commander-in-chief of
the King’s forces in Scotland, conceived it his duty to attend the
execution of the criminal. All the ceremonies usual on occasions of
this kind having been gone through, and the regiment formed into three
sides of a square, the unfortunate prisoner was conducted to the spot,
marked by his coffin being placed on it, where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> to receive his
death. The execution party, consisting of twelve men, placed in three
rows of four each, were advanced within a few paces of their object,
when the front rank knelt down, the second stooped, and the third stood
upright, that thus three several fires might be delivered, and the
destruction of the victim be secured.</p>

<p>Gordon had now also knelt down, and there was only the signal
wanting&mdash;of which the prisoner had, as is usual in such cases, the
control&mdash;to complete the tragedy, when, just as the unhappy man was
about to make that signal, the Duke of Argyle, who had been eyeing him
attentively for some time, suddenly left those with whom he had been
conversing, and waving to the execution party to withhold their fire,
galloped up to the culprit, whom he thus abruptly addressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Young man, were you at the battle of Sherriffmuir?”</p>

<p>To this question, so unexpectedly put, it was some time before Gordon
could make any reply; his mind being wholly absorbed by thoughts
appropriate to his awful situation. When first put to him, therefore,
he merely looked at the querist with a vacant stare, as if wholly
unconscious of the purport of what had been said to him. In a few
seconds, however, he recollected himself, and, with a firm voice,
replied that he was at that battle.</p>

<p>“Did you see me,” continued the Duke, on his making this answer, “in
any situation of particular peril on that day!”</p>

<p>Gordon now in his turn looked at the Duke with a scrutinizing eye, and
thought that he recognised a face which he had seen before. He began,
in short, to imagine that there was a resemblance, though he did not
think it by any means so strong as to warrant him in saying so, between
the person who now addressed him, and the officer whose life he had
saved at Sheriffmuir.</p>

<p>“I do not know, sir,” said Gordon in reply to the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> question put
to him, “that I saw <em>you</em> in any situation of particular peril on
that day; but I saw an officer of our army in such a situation, and I
believe I helped a little to bring him out of the scrape.”</p>

<p>“You ran the fellow who was about to slay that officer through the
body with your bayonet, did you not?” exclaimed the Duke, with eager
rapidity.</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” said Gordon, who yet knew nothing of the quality of the
person who addressed him.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied Argyle. “Well, sir,” he continued, “the life you
saved was mine, and I shall now try to repay the debt by saving yours,
if I can.”</p>

<p>Having said this, the Duke turned round and waved to the officer who
was in command of the troops present to come to him.</p>

<p>On his approach&mdash;“Colonel,” he said, “I wish this execution delayed. Do
you, therefore, sir, if you please, order the firing party to retire,
and let the regiment be marched back to its quarters. I, of course,
take the whole responsibility of this proceeding on myself, Colonel.”</p>

<p>The officer to whom this was addressed bowed and retired to execute the
orders given him; and in a few minutes thereafter, the regiment, in the
centre of which Gordon was placed, marched off the ground to the sound
of cheerful music.</p>

<p>On reaching the Castle, the Duke desired Gordon to be brought before
him, when he proceeded to examine minutely into the particulars of
his case, with the view, evidently, of eliciting as many favourable
and extenuating circumstances as possible; and he evinced great
satisfaction in finding that there were a good many of these. There was
the youth and inexperience of the prisoner; the fact of his having been
only a day or two enlisted; of his having received no bounty (which
was the case); the evidence that his crime had proceeded from ignorance
of military law, and not from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> design; and, above all, there was to be
taken into account his treatment by the insurgents&mdash;considerations, all
of which were crowned by the fact of his having saved the life of the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of this examination, Gordon was placed again in
confinement; and for an entire week he heard nothing more of the
proceedings regarding him. Early one morning, however, at the end of
this period, the Duke of Argyle, entered his apartment, when, pulling
out a paper from his pocket&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gordon,” he said, “your life is saved. His Majesty’s clemency has been
extended to you, in consideration of the extenuating circumstances
in your case; and here is your pardon. Here, also,” he continued,
producing another paper, which he handed to the prisoner, “is your
discharge. And here again,” he said, placing a purse of money in
Gordon’s hand, and smiling as he spoke, “is a passport. And now, my
good fellow,” he added, “take my advice, and return to your friends as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>We will not take up the reader’s time by attempting to describe
Gordon’s feelings on this occasion. Suffice it to say, that they were
as wild, and tumultuous, and joyful as such a singular and unexpected
change in his situation can be supposed to have been capable of
exciting. These feelings, however, did not distract him so much as to
prevent him following the Duke’s counsel, which exactly jumped with his
own inclinations.</p>

<p>After thanking his benefactor in the most grateful language he could
command, he instantly quitted the apartment in which he had been
confined, and hurried out of the castle, neither looking to the right
nor to the left, till he had reached the heart of the city, when he
stopped for a moment to breathe and to reflect on his happiness, which
was so great, however, that he had some difficulty in believing in its
reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In an hour afterwards, Gordon once more set out to join his old
friends, whose encampment he reached on the following day, and again
resumed his old habits and station in the erratic community. Again,
too, three or four additional years passed away; but they did not pass
now without bringing some of the changes which are interwoven with
the lot of mankind, and which fall to the share equally of gipsy and
prince. During these three or four years, Jean Gordon’s husband, and
her two brothers, had been gathered to their fathers, her daughter had
attained the stature and the years of womanhood, and she herself was
beginning to feel the weakened energies of age. Another change in this
little community, during these three or four years, was the elevation
of Gordon to the chief place in it&mdash;a situation to which he was
unanimously elected on the death of Jean’s husband, who had hitherto
been looked up to as the head of the fraternity.</p>

<p>It was about this period, and as the gang were one day strolling up
the banks of the Tweed, near a place called Upsetlington, under the
conduct of Gordon, who was leading them on one of their usual wandering
expeditions, a salmon cobble, in which were two persons, were seen
sweeping down the river, which, being swollen to an unusual height
with nearly an entire week’s heavy and incessant rain, was at this
moment tearing along with the most dreadful fury. The day, besides,
was widely tempestuous; and, as the wind was blowing directly in the
teeth of the current, there was a roughness in the middle of the stream
which would have endangered the safety of a much better sea-boat than a
salmon-cobble&mdash;a truth this, which was but too evident on the present
occasion.</p>

<p>The cobble, which was now being borne down by the stream, seemed to
have completely freed itself from the control of those on board of
it, and was careering along with an impetuosity and total want of
direction, which left no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> doubt on the minds of those who beheld it
that a catastrophe was at hand. It was evident, in short, that the boat
must very soon be swamped and overset; and in this opinion the persons
on board of her seemed themselves to concur, as they made no other
effort to save themselves than waving their hands, from time to time,
to those on the banks, to intimate their distress, and to invite their
assistance.</p>

<p>But, although these unfortunate persons had been willing to make any
effort to extricate themselves from their perilous situation, they
could not; for their oars had been swept away by the current, and they
were thus left perfectly helpless.</p>

<p>Gordon marked the desperate situation of the unwilling voyagers, and on
the instant determined on making an effort to save them.</p>

<p>Near the spot where he stood looking on this appalling scene, there
happened to be another cobble lying, which its owner had drawn high up
on the bank, to keep it out of the reach of the current; and its two
oars were still in it.</p>

<p>Gordon eyed the boat for a moment, and in that moment his resolution
was taken. He seized the cobble with both hands, and being a remarkably
powerful man, with one effort hurled it into the stream. This done, he
leapt into it, grasped the oars, in the use of which he was singularly
expert, and dashed headlong after the runaway bark, which, at the
imminent risk of his own life, and with great exertion, he succeeded in
capturing and bringing safely to shore.</p>

<p>The persons thus saved, by the gallantry of Gordon, from inevitable
death, proved to be the owner of the cobble, and a Mr Riddell, from
Hawick, a respectable elderly man, and reputed to be extremely wealthy,
whom the former had been endeavouring to ferry across the river.</p>

<p>When the party had fairly landed, Mr Riddel took Gordon by the hand,
and, pressing it warmly, thanked him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> the most grateful terms, for
the important service he had rendered him. “But, young man,” he added,
“I do not mean to pay you with thanks alone. It is my intention to give
you a much more substantial proof of my gratitude than mere words.
Thank God, I am able to do so; and the will is not wanting. You shall
go with me to Hawick, my young friend, and I will then see in what way
I can best shew my sense of the obligation I owe you. In the meantime,
take this,” he said, handing Gordon a purse, “as an earnest for the
future. But you must come to Hawick with me. This you must do&mdash;I will
take no denial. I am childless, man,” he added, smiling, “although I
was not always so; and there’s no saying, if ye quit this wandering
life of yours, and betake ye to an honest calling, what good fortune
may arise to you out of this day’s occurrences.”</p>

<p>“Nae sayin, indeed,” here chimed in Jean Gordon, who had been listening
to what Mr Riddel said with intense interest, and with a degree of
agitation which it would have been very difficult for a mere onlooker
to have accounted for.</p>

<p>“Nae sayin, indeed, what guid fortune may arise to the lad oot o’ what
has happened this day. To Hawick wi’ ye he maun gang, Mr Riddel,”
continued Jean, who know every individual in the country for fifty
miles round; “an’ he couldna gang wi’ a nearer freen, tak my word for
that.”</p>

<p>“He could not go with one who would be more willing to be his friend,
at any rate, Jean,” said Mr Riddel, who also knew the gipsy well, both
by sight and name, and smiling as he spoke.</p>

<p>“An’ guid richt he has to your friendship, Mr Riddel,” replied Jean.</p>

<p>“That he has, Jean,” said the former.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> “The man who has saved my life
has indeed a good right to my friendship; and he shall have it.”</p>

<p>“He has maybe ither claims on ye forbye that, though, Mr Riddel.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Well, he may; although that is surely enough. But what other
claims do you allude to, Jean? I shall be glad to know what they are,
that I may discharge them all at once.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall know, Mr Riddel,” replied Jean, with a sudden
determination of manner. “They’re noo awa that micht tak ony scaith
frae what I’ll noo tell ye; an’, forbye, it’s a thing I hae lang
resolved upon, an’ sae I’ll e’en tak this opportunity o’ doin’t. Come
aside wi’ me, here, a wee bit, Mr Riddel,” added Jean; “an’ you, too,
Gordon,” she said; “come, till I speak to ye baith.” And she led the
way to a little distance from the other persons who were present on the
occasion, and who had hitherto been auditors of all that passed.</p>

<p>“Mr Riddel,” now said Jean, “do ye mind the Hawick Spate?”</p>

<p>“Mind it!” replied the person addressed&mdash;“to be sure I do, Jean; I have
but too much reason to mind it.” And here Mr Riddel’s voice became
tremulous with emotion. “It deprived me of my only child&mdash;of the only
child I ever had. This you doubtless know, Jean,” he continued; “as
everybody in Hawick, and for many miles round it, who recollects the
spate, knows that my child&mdash;and a fine little fellow he was&mdash;was swept
away in his cradle, by the stream, and never afterwards heard tell of.
The cradle was, indeed, found,” added Mr Riddel, in a melancholy tone,
“but not the infant. But why do ye ask this question, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Just to bring to yer recollection the very circumstance ye hae
mentioned, Mr Riddel,” replied the gipsy. “Noo, sir,” she went on, “tak
a look o’ that lad, [pointing to Gordon,] an’ tell me if ye wad ken him
to be yer ain son. And you, Gordon,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> “look at that gentleman,
an’ see if ye wad tak him to be yer faither; for, as God’s in heaven,”
she continued, “that’s the relationship in which ye twa staun to are
anither!”</p>

<p>“Woman! what do you mean?” exclaimed Mr. Riddel in an angry tone. “Are
you deranged? What absurd nonsense is this you talk? I never had any
son but the child that was drowned.”</p>

<p>“I didna say ye had, Mr. Riddel,” replied Jean; “but that’s yer son,
nevertheless. This I swear, by a’ my hopes o’ a hereafter!”</p>

<p>“Gracious God!&mdash;explain, woman! explain!” exclaimed Mr. Riddel, now
greatly agitated&mdash;a glimmering of the possibility of what had actually
occurred suddenly bursting on his mind. “Tell me, I beseech you, what
you mean at once, and without further evasion.”</p>

<p>Thus entreated, Jean Gordon proceeded to detail the whole of the
circumstances connected with the saving of the child (whom, we presume,
we need not inform the reader in more explicit terms, was, indeed, the
son of the person to whose paternity Jean ascribed him) from the Hawick
flood.</p>

<p>When she had concluded&mdash;</p>

<p>“Extraordinary! most extraordinary!” exclaimed Mr. Riddel, now
overwhelmed with a variety of new and strange feelings. “Can it be
possible? O God! thy ways are inscrutable. But what proof have I of the
truth of your story, Jean?” said the agitated father, gazing on his son.</p>

<p>“Proof!” exclaimed the gipsy; “look at the lad, Mr. Riddel&mdash;look at
him, closely; an’ if ye dinna find proof enough in that face, ye’ll be
hard to convince. Is he no your very counterpart?”</p>

<p>This part of Jean’s evidence was, indeed, of the most irrefragable
kind; for the resemblance was remarkably striking.</p>

<p>“An’ if that’ll no satisfy ye,” she went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> “is there no half-a-dozen
an’ mair o’ oor folk, that saw the hail affair, an’ that’ll swear to
the truth o’ a’ that I’ve said?&mdash;an’ ye may tak them up, ane by ane,
this minute, if ye like, an’ examine them a’ separately on the subject;
an’ if ye find ane o’ them contradick me in the sma’est particular,
dinna believe ae word o’ what I hae said. An’, if that’ll no convince
ye yet, Mr Riddell,” she continued, “ye shall hae mair proof still.
Come here, Gordon,” she said, addressing the young man, who, in silent
amazement, was listening to this extraordinary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i>&mdash;“sit
down.” He obeyed; and she pulled off the shoe and stocking from his
left leg. Then holding up the lad’s naked foot, “Do ye ken thae twa
taes, then, Mr Riddell?” she inquired, pointing, at the same time, to
the little toe and the one adjoining to which the former was united.</p>

<p>“He is my son! he is my son! I can no longer doubt it,” exclaimed Mr
Riddel, in a rapture of joy, on seeing this proof of his identity. And
he rushed towards Gordon, and folded him in his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh! cruel woman!” he said, after the first burst of emotion had so far
subsided as to allow him to speak&mdash;“to keep my boy so long from me, and
to cause me so many weary nights and days, and long years of sorrow and
mourning on his account! But I forgive you,” he immediately added; “I
forgive you, in consideration of the happiness which you have this day
conferred on me, late though it be.”</p>

<p>“You may forgie me, Mr Riddel,” said the now repentant gipsy; “but
I canna forgie mysel. I hae made some amends, noo, hooever,” she
continued; “an’ that’s a relief to my conscience. But I hae still
another score o’ the same kind to pay off in another quarter; and it
shall be dune at a’ hazards&mdash;but o’ this, mair hereafter. I hae dune
ye a great wrang, Mr Riddel,” continued Jean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> “but I was aye kind to
yer bairn. I hae been a mother to him ever since I first took him in my
arms, as I daur say he will, sae far as he recollects, bear witness.
He’ll say that muckle for me, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“That I will, Jean,” said Gordon, taking her kindly by the hand; “an’
may I be forgotten by Him that’s aboon when I forget you, or yer
motherly kindness to and care owre me!”</p>

<p>“Enough, enough, Francis Riddel,” said his father&mdash;“for that was the
name, my son, I intended to have given you, and it is the name by which
I shall now and henceforth designate you&mdash;I forgive her. Nay, I not
only forgive her, man, but, if she will quit this wandering life of
hers, I will see to her future subsistence and comfort as long as she
lives.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, Mr Riddel, for your goodness,” said Jean, “but I’m no
just yet prepared for that step. But, when I am, which will maybe be
very sune, I’ll no fail to seek the shelter ye sae kindly offer me.”</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, full time, now, that we should say what were the
feelings of Francis&mdash;as we, too, must now call him&mdash;in the singular
circumstances in which he thus so suddenly and unexpectedly found
himself placed. These were of a mingled kind. He felt all the joy
natural on such an impressive occasion as that of having a lost&mdash;or, at
least, an unknown&mdash;parent restored. He felt, too, a satisfaction in the
promotion which his personal interests would now certainly experience,
and with the idea of the respectable footing on which he would now be
placed with the world. But there were two circumstances in particular
that weighed against these, and tended to lessen the effect they would
otherwise have had. One of these was his attachment to the wandering
life to which he had been accustomed, and which he saw, with regret,
he must now abandon. The other, and by far the most distressing one
to him&mdash;was the probability that he would now also be called upon to
renounce his beloved Rosie. On this point, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> determined to
remain obstinate, and rather to forfeit his father’s favour, with all
the advantages that might accrue from it, than to abandon her to whom
he already considered himself bound by the most sacred ties. On this
subject, however, Francis prudently resolved to say nothing, in the
meantime, but just to allow matters to take their course, till proper
time and place should present themselves for announcing his resolution,
and carrying that resolution into effect.</p>

<p>Mr Riddel now again repeated his proposal, that his son should
instantly accompany him home; and, with this proposal, Francis
complied, although he certainly did not do so without much secret
reluctance and regret, for the reasons which have been already
explained.</p>

<p>After bidding, then, a kind adieu to his former associates&mdash;a most
affectionate one to Jean, whom he bound, by a solemn promise, to call
upon him, in a few days, at Hawick&mdash;and whispering two or three words
of consolation into Rosie’s ear&mdash;Francis set off with his father; and,
in due time, both arrived in safety at Mr. Riddel’s residence, in the
town above named, where the former was quickly installed in all the
rights and privileges of a son and heir, and as such was recognised by
all his father’s friends and acquaintances; his mother having been by
this time many years dead.</p>

<p>In about four weeks after the occurrence of the circumstances just
related, the gipsy gang to which Francis Riddel had belonged, appeared
one evening, about dusk, at their old station in the vicinity of
Hawick. It was the precise spot where Francis had been rescued from the
flood some seven and twenty years before, and was a favourite locality
of the wandering tribes.</p>

<p>Delighted with the intelligence of their arrival, which soon reached
him, Francis, carefully however concealing his intention from his
father, stole down to the gipsy encampment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> where, as he expected, he
found his beloved Rosie, to see whom, indeed, was the chief, if not the
sole object of his visit. The joy of the lovers at meeting&mdash;for they
had not seen or heard of each other since they parted on the day of
the adventure on the Tweed&mdash;need not be dwelt upon, as it was exactly
what is usual in such cases; but other circumstances arose from this
interview which it may be more worth while to record.</p>

<p>“My father,” said Francis, addressing Rosie, as they sat together on
a green bank, at a little distance from the gipsy encampment, “has
set his face against our marriage. He has said that in nothing will
he oppose me, but in that. But that, if I disobey him there, well as
he loves me, he will disinherit me, and leave me penniless. ‘Marry a
gipsy girl,’ he said, ‘and bring disgrace upon your connections! Never,
never, with my consent.’ Ha! ha!” exclaimed Francis, contemptuously,
“little does he know, honest man, what a trifle all his wealth and all
his possessions are, and would be, were they ten times greater, when
put into the scale against such love as mine for thee, Rosie. He may
keep his wealth, for I <em>will</em> marry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The Laird o’ Upha’s dochter,” suddenly struck in Jean Gordon, who
had now approached the lovers, unperceived. “Ay, the Laird o’ Upha’s
dochter,” she repeated. “She’ll be yer wife, Francis. Winna she?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Jean, not her, whoever she be,” said Francis, laughingly,
and flinging his arms affectionately around Rosie’s neck. “Not her, but
my own sweet, dark-eyed gipsy girl here&mdash;<em>your</em> daughter, Jean.”</p>

<p>“The Laird o’ Upha’s dochter, I tell ye, ye’ll marry, nevertheless,
Francis. Not mine; for I hae nane. Yer faither ’ll then hae nae
objection to yer linkin to, I’m thinkin; for a weel-tochered lass
she’ll be&mdash;an’ o’ gentle bluid has she come.”</p>

<p>From this point, the little that now remains of our story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> will be
best conducted to its termination, by plain and concise narrative.
Francis and Rosie now learned, with, overwhelming amazement, that the
latter was indeed a daughter of Maitland of Uphall’s, an old and highly
respectable family, and not of Jean Gordon’s; and that she had been
stolen in her infancy by the gang with which she was now associated.
Jean, also, now informed them that she had already announced at Uphall
that their daughter still lived, and had accompanied this announcement
by a promise to restore her within three days to her parents.</p>

<p>The circumstance of Rosie’s real parentage, Francis lost no time in
communicating to his father, who heard it at first with incredulity;
but promised that, if the facts were found to be as stated, he would
not only withdraw his objections to their marriage, but would do all in
his power to promote it.</p>

<p>To this, we have only to add, that the identity of Rosie having been
proven to Uphall’s entire satisfaction, he acknowledged her as his
child, and soon after gave his consent to her union to Francis Riddel,
who had been equally expeditious, as in the case of his own father, in
informing him of his claims on his daughter.</p>

<p>The lovers were accordingly married, and lived many happy years
together, filling a highly respectable station in society, and esteemed
by all who knew them for the strict propriety of their conduct in all
the relations of life.</p>

<p>They left sons and daughters, who inherited their wealth, which was
very considerable, but none of whom ever experienced, so far as ever we
heard, any of their vicissitudes.</p>

<h2>THE AVENGER;<br />
<small>OR,</small><br />
THE LEGEND OF MARY LEE.</h2>


<p>An old legend describeth to us “The Castle,” a large residence, which,
some centuries ago, graced, with its high towers, the banks of the
river Annan, perhaps one of the finest of the Scotch rivers if all
the elements of beauty are taken into account. “The Castle” stood
towards the Solway, and was the seat of a family that had risen to some
distinction as commoners, from the possession of considerable wealth,
acquired by an ancestor, who had got possession of some lucrative
monopolies from the first of the Jameses. The family name was Ashley,
of English origin, but the more early members having intermarried with
daughters of Scotland, and their fortunes having flourished, for the
first time, on her then poor uncultivated soil, they gradually came to
lose every quality and mark of the country from which they originated
except the name.</p>

<p>Robert Ashley, the proprietor of this residence at the time our story
commences, was a widower, having an only son alive, the heir-expectant
of his father, and the proprietor, in anticipation, of all the
rights of the property. The young man, whose name was also Robert,
was possessed of high feelings of love and poetry; but, as is often
the case, he allowed these to outstep the bounds of morals&mdash;living a
luxurious life of pleasure, suited to his strong susceptibilities,
but altogether unsanctified by a single restraint, which the greatest
libertines often offer, as a sacrifice to offended virtue. He had
been a follower of gipsies, and got from them the gipsy name of
Robin Ary, pronounced Robin-a-Ree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> The only palliation his most
partial friend could offer for his extravagant conduct, was, that his
amours, of which he had many, were not the result of a grovelling
propensity of lust, cultivated for its own sake, and unredeemed by any
concomitant affections of the heart. His intrigues, though all ending
in gratifications of gross passion, began in the excitement of love;
not that love, the influence of which tends to elevate and refine the
other sentiments; but still a love which, in the world, very often
passes for its more pure ally&mdash;using the same language, exhibiting the
same external marks, and, unfortunately, so completely personating
it, as to deceive the confiding hearts of the objects to whom it is
directed. The easily lighted, fickle, heartless, and seducing passion,
was the bane of the young man&mdash;springing up, with sudden violence, on
the first contemplation of beauty&mdash;rendering him uneasy till it was
communicated and miserable till it was gratified&mdash;too often by the
ruin of his victim. A fine form and expressive countenance, a command
of the language of the heart, and riches, rendered him one of the most
dangerous companions of the fair sex of his time; yet paradoxical as
it may be, his character for success in rendering miserable that sex
whose happiness ought to be the pride and satisfaction of him who has
arrogated to himself the title of lord of the creation, instead of
keeping victims out of his way, seemed to lure them into his power; at
least, there could be no doubt that the gentleman gipsy Robin-a-Ree
had always more admirers than any other young man on the north of the
Solway. So it seems to be, that vice is sometimes ordained to be fed to
repletion, producing in the end the ruin of its powers and properties,
which, otherwise, might be exercised for greater evil.</p>

<p>On the lands pertaining to “The Castle,” there was the little port,
which we must disguise under the name of Fairhaven, where resided
Gilbert Lee, a fisherman, whose boat was often required by Robin for
pleasure excursions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> Solway. Gilbert had a daughter, Mary,
whose youth, being eight years younger than Ashley, had, for a time,
protected her from the dangerous attention of the young laird. This
Mary Lee was a peculiar girl; she was accounted the handsomest in
Fairhaven; and her father had only one fault to impute to her&mdash;a most
unforgiving spirit. Kind and affectionate to all who exhibited those
qualities to her, Mary seldom forgot or forgave an injury or an insult;
and so strongly marked was her character in this respect, that her
school antipathies remained with her, and increased as she grew up&mdash;no
kindness or conciliation having the effect of modifying or mollifying
the determination and bitterness of her hatreds. So says our chronicle,
and so is it often in the world, that the most opposite feelings and
passions&mdash;like the nerves of the human system, which, operating equally
on the gall-bladder and the heart, are bound up in the same sheath&mdash;may
be found in the same individual, acting with equal and antagonist
forces, and realizing a species of manichæism which has perplexed
optimist moralists from the beginning of the world. As the good is
strong, so often is the evil, in the same individual; and it would have
been hard to say whether Mary Lee’s loves were stronger or weaker than
her hatreds.</p>

<p>“O Mary,” her father would say, “he will be a happy or a miserable man
wha gets ye for his lot on earth; he will get either the sweet honey
o’ yer young and loving heart, or the sting which, as in the bee,
receives its poison from that very honey itsel’: so do we see a’ sweet
things mair productive o’ sourness than the bitters which we avoid, and
darkness is ne’er so visible as when licht is its nearest neibor, and
hauds the candle to its ill favoured face.”</p>

<p>Now, Mary understood, perhaps, but little of her father’s quaint
remarks, and little did she know of the possession of qualities which
were destined to stand out in such prominent and startling relief
from the mellowed hues of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> Christian faith. Has God, for his
own purposes, hid us from ourselves, that our sense of free agency
should remain unimpaired by the knowledge of the connate bent of our
apparently fated inclinations? Poor Mary Lee acted from her impulses;
nor did she see danger. There is the “mid-deep,” which the sailors of
the Solway point out to the passenger who looks on the fallacious calm,
as it hovers o’er the graves of many a drowned mariner. There is a
moral mid-deep in the paths of most of us, but which we never see till
we are engulphed.</p>

<p>As Mary Lee grew up, she came necessarily under the view of young
Ashley, who, as he called for the boat, noticed the young maiden
sitting on the beach, throwing the glances of her blue eye on the
mirror of the silvery Solway; a fair type of her own nature, though she
was unconscious of the similitude&mdash;beautiful in its soft and playful
undulations, but terrible in its rage.</p>

<p>“Have we got a mermaid sitting here?” said Robin, on a day, to a
companion. “How like she is to the pictured fancy of that creature of
imagination! She has only to let her hair fall over her shoulders,
and send forth one of those plaintive; seductive cries which, like
the singing of the Sicilian virgins mentioned by Ovid, tempt poor
passengers ashore to their destruction, to realize the type in its
greatest perfection. Well, by the way, I think I would have risked
myself in the arms of those famous sirens, who are represented to have
been so cruel as to kill their lovers&mdash;at least I would trust myself
with that fair one. What thinkest thou of my courage?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Robin,” replied his friend, George Henley, a neighbouring
laird’s son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> “I fear the danger which Ovid represents as being all on
the side of the sailors, who listened to these virgins, would, in your
case, be transferred to the charmer; and yet they say that Mary Lee,
with all her beauty and apparent mildness, has all the siren about her
but the fledged tail; and, if the feathers are there awanting, I fear
the deficiency is supplied by a sting.”</p>

<p>The hint thrown out by Henley increased the desire of Robin to get
acquainted with Mary; for such is the fate of those who are consigned
to the intoxications of vice, that they indulge in morbid desires,
which, as in the case of the gourmand, produce in their gratifications
all the effects of poison. “A fury for a lover!” he ejaculated. “Good!
I have had too many soft, breaking hearts. Their very softness has
palled upon my appetite; and, as the lover of gourmandize requires
stimulants to whip up the jaded powers of his overwrought stomach, my
wearied heart longs for a spice of piquant amativeness, to resuscitate
its flagging energies.”</p>

<p>Such reflections are but too common with the young rakes of all times;
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original read 'Robin-a-Dee'">Robin-a-Ree</ins> acted upon them, and he was not long in producing an effect
upon Mary Lee. He spoke to her at first merely as the daughter of
the fisherman; putting questions to her, which he could himself have
answered&mdash;but, while he was apparently a careless interrogator, he did
all in his power, by the shew of his properties, to become a querist of
a heart which had hitherto been left to question itself, and to answer
its own questions. How few young women can withstand the graces of a
handsome youth&mdash;and how often is the poison drunk by the heart, before
the mind is conscious of the draught! Mary Lee thought, as she looked
upon the youthful Ashley, that the young fishermen of Fairhaven were
surely not made of the same flesh and blood. Ashley knew the force of
his natural endowments, and he brought in aid of those the flatteries
of the deceiver. What more is required to complete the work of love?
A good regard of the flatterer, followed by a good regard of the
flattered, is, alas! often all that is necessary in the composition of
female devotion.</p>

<p>The frequent meetings which Robin had with Mary produced the usual
effects. Her heart was what every woman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> ought to be&mdash;that is, if
there were no bad men in the world&mdash;it loved at once and for ever.
Every pulse of life acknowledged the power which had come like a spirit
and thrown a charm over her existence; the world was now centred in
one object; her father and her home lost their magic influences of
early associations; even the shade of her mother, which was enshrined
in her imagination as a part of the mind itself, faded into a thinner
existence than even that of a vision, as she revelled in the first
enthusiastic enjoyment of maiden affection. Ashley saw with delight,
mixed with some misgivings as to the responsibility of such a devotion,
the absolute resignation of a full and bursting heart to the dissembled
schemes of a professed libertine. Proud of his victory, he paused,
like the cruel lord of the jungle, to play with the victim destined
to a protracted immolation; and she, deluded creature! received,
with panting eagerness, the caresses which she considered the fruit
of a love equal to her own. As she hung upon his bosom and fed his
eyes with the soft beams of a first love, shining through tears of
kindness and devotion, who could have observed, in that light, more
danger than belongs to so innocent a thing as a woman’s smile? Robert
Ashley had known by experience, that a woman’s eye that does not shine
on her seducer, generally shines not at all, unless it be in the
phosphorescent brightness of the corruption of the grave. Mary Lee was,
like other women, an object to be possessed, not feared; Ashley enjoyed
her present devotion in the exultation of pride, and her subsequent
ruin in a certain hope of reality.</p>

<p>Wandering through the thick woods of “The Castle,” Mary Lee drank
deeper of the intoxicating draught, as her appetite was increased by
the inspiring influences of romantic scenes.</p>

<p>“How is it, Robin,” she said, with the familiarity which love begets
on innocence&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>“how is it that now the woods of the Castle are to me
so dear, and I ever think that every mavis and blackbird in the thick
groves are to me little messengers o’ guid news. Before you spoke to
me, I was fond o’ the rippling waves that come as if they were sent by
the corpses in the ‘dead deep,’ to tell their griefs to us on land.
But now my thoughts are aff the sea, and the Castle, wi’ a’ its braw
trees and flowers, is aye present to me, as used to be the shade o’ my
mither.”</p>

<p>“Thou art fond of reasons, my gentle Mary,” replied Robin, “and perhaps
canst say why thou wast formerly so fond of the sea. Perhaps some young
fisherman had then a part of the heart which now I hope is all my own.”</p>

<p>“An’ weel, Robin, may ye say its a’ yer ain,” said Mary; “for, sleepin’
or waukin’, I think only o’ you, an’ the foes that wad tak you an’ mak
you the lover o’ anither. Catherine Hamilton o’ Castlegreen kenned
naething o’ my heart yesterday, when, as ye left the village, she saw
me looking at her as she looked at you. The lady ca’ed the fisherman’s
dochter ‘wretch,’ but she heard no answer fra me. At that time you
looked back to her and smiled, and she forgot me, but I will mind her
to the day I dee. I could have forgiven her if she hadna been so bonny,
and if ye hadna given her the glance that should have come to me. But
it’s only in the thick woods that Robin-a-Ree kens the fisherman’s
dochter o’ Fairhaven.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, my Mary, none of thy reproofs. Thou knowest that I was a
favourite of Catherine Hamilton’s before I knew thee, and it would not
have been courteous to shake off an old acquaintance because my Mary
was present and requested all my attention.”</p>

<p>“Weel, weel, ye ken I forgive ye,” answered Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> “and my forgiveness
is as real as my love, but I have ae request to mak, and that is&mdash;that,
if ye dinna choose to ken me in Fairhaven when Catherine is in the
village, ye will keep within the bounds o’ the Castle lands. That
leddie lies far out o’ my way, if she crossna your path when I am
near; but the blasts that blew owre the Mull o’ Galloway are nae
sterner to the boatmen o’ the Solway than will be my scorn if she come
atween me and my love.”</p>

<p>And, as she concluded, she evinced a degree of determination in her
voice and manner, which caught the attention of Ashley. But he saw
nothing in it, except a little jealousy, which only measured by its
intensity the strength of her love; and his pride was inflamed by the
demonstration, while the ardour of his purpose was increased. Throwing
his arms around the waist of the still somewhat excited maiden, he
removed her jealousy by blandishments, and vowed that he had no
affection for Catherine Hamilton, who could never stand in a nearer or
dearer relation to him than that of acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>Thereafter for a long period the groves of “The Castle,” were
frequented by the lovers. The affection of Mary engrossed all her
thoughts and feelings, and lent an eloquence to her words and looks,
which, to Robin, seemed different from any demonstrations of affection
he had yet witnessed. His feelings became interested to a degree beyond
what he could have expected as the result of a few meetings with a
fisherman’s daughter; and he felt it as a reproach to his true and
genuine character of libertinism, that he was in this instance more in
earnest, and more sincere in his love, than he had been in any former
instance. The feeling was increased by the apparent determination
of Mary to defend the fortress of her virtue. The gipsy fancier had
been so fortunate in his former amours, that success had made him
domineering and impatient of restraint, while a firm opposition hurt
his pride, and increased his desire of victory. In this instance, his
love&mdash;bastard in its nature as it still was&mdash;became increased by Mary’s
firmness, and he was compelled to have recourse to expedients which
implicated his honour in a greater degree than the ordinary schemes of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> seducer, bad as they are, generally do. Finding all his endeavours
to overcome her virtue unavailing, he had recourse to promises of
<em>honourable intentions</em>&mdash;those fatal sappers of female innocence,
which, directed only where there is strength, are relied upon as the
last resources of insidious assailants.</p>

<p>The heart of Mary, occupied as it was with one of the strongest
affections of human nature&mdash;in her instance, all-engrossing and
resistless&mdash;did not so far act the traitress to her understanding, as
to induce her to resign her honour, without a condition. Her youth
and innocence, rendering her unacquainted with the arts of the world
and its vices, suggested, as the only result of a mutual attachment,
a union of the parties in holy wedlock; and, when Ashley spoke of
marriage, as a thing to take place between them, after the death of his
father, she only felt surprised at the ceremony being postponed. That
these expectations of Mary did not please Ashley, is not unlikely; but
the only other effect produced by them, was to make him promise more
fervently, and with stronger protestations, that he would abide by his
word, as he was a gentleman and a man of honour. Alas! the love of
woman is credulous, as well as blind; and if we did not believe those
who are dearest to us of all the world, who is there in it to whom
faith should be given? Mary believed; and, like millions who have had
the same faith, and the same apparently irrefragable grounds whereon
to build it, she was undone. He who takes the honey sometimes gets the
sting; the little insect which supplies the figure of speech fulfils a
purpose in nature, when, after its support, during the period when no
flowers exist, from which to get a supply, has been taken from it, and
it is consigned to want and death, it throws away in its vengeance on
the spoiler, the life which is only of use to dart the sting, and leave
its spark of vitality along with the poison in the wound.</p>

<p>As time waned, the ruined Mary felt her passion increase and saw her
lover’s decay. He came now no longer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> grove where the sweet
dalliance of a new passion ruffled the silence with the music of
muffled sighs. She went at the accustomed hour, and at the hour not
accustomed, and she returned without bringing with her a token that the
hope of the morning had found a resting-place at even. The willow where
they had met retained its charm, and, long after she had given up hopes
of his coming, she sat under it, and wept bitterly for a loss which no
power on earth could make up to her. But her tears flowed in vain&mdash;for
Robin-a-Ree came not; and her groans only awakened the dull and drowsy
ear of the hind, who, driving his cattle from the field, thought it
strange that a woman should weep, and whistled his tune, which her
sobbing had interrupted for a moment. The breaking heart of love has no
consolation, unless when its sorrowful indications imitate the vulgar
hues of bodily disease, and then it can command a prescription; yet
sometimes it finds for itself, and in its own recesses, a poison, which
has more virtue in it than all the simples of the leech.</p>

<p>Now a considerable time had passed without any intelligence of Ashley,
when, one day, as Mary sat under the tree, she saw a gentleman
approach, whom she recognised as Ashley’s friend, George Henley. He
accosted her in a bold and familiar style; and told her that her friend
and lover had gone to Edinburgh, in the company of Miss Catherine
Hamilton, and had commissioned him to yield her what consolation was
in his power, in the shape of supplying his place as a new and fresh
lover&mdash;a commission which he could have no inclination to disobey,
when he contemplated her beauty, and recollected the favours she had
bestowed on his fortunate friend. The salutation struck the unhappy
girl dumb, and Henley mistook the benumbing effects of incipient
despair as a passive acquiescence in his ribald sentiments&mdash;a consent
to his unhallowed purposes. Under this impression, he was about to
clasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> his arms round her waist, when the enraged and frantic girl
struck him a blow, concentrating in its force the collected strength
of her frenzied energies, and stunned him beyond what could have been
conceived to be the effect of a woman’s uplifted arm. But injured
virtue&mdash;and poor Mary Lee’s feelings had still a virtue in them&mdash;has
a power which proud man has been often brought to acknowledge and to
feel. The cowardly braggart, only brave in pseudo love, was so tamed by
the blow, and so humiliated by the noble attitude of the asserter of
her dearest rights, that he slunk away as if he had been caught in an
act of larceny, or stung by a serpent.</p>

<p>“Go,” cried she, “an’ tell him wha commissioned ye, how weel ye have
done your duty, an’ how I have performed mine. Think, as ye look on
the earth&mdash;for ye canna face heaven&mdash;that there is the connach worm
crawlin’ amang yer feet, claimin’ the kindred o’ ane wha wasna formed
to look in the face o’ a woman! Shun, as the screech-owl does, the
licht o’ day, yon eagle that perches on the trystin’ oak, for the gleam
o’ its bright e’e will, as the sun puts out the humble peat-moss ingle,
blind the dastardly wretch, wha canna abide the look o’ the woman he
has insulted. If Robin-a-Ree sent ye to me, tell him that I have sent
ye to him, to say that Mary Lee has, in the wreck o’ her feelin’s,
enough left to fire the house an’ hearth o’ his new affections.”</p>

<p>A strange speech, and delivered with the impassioned mien and voice of
the Pythoness. A new and hitherto unfelt power and energy had seized
the frame of this strange girl, the instinctive enthusiasm of a deep
revenge had come upon her like an inspiration. She turned her eyes from
the direction in which Henley had gone, and, with downcast look and a
brooding melancholy, sought her home.</p>

<p>Thereafter, it was currently reported in the village that Robert Ashley
was about to be married to Catherine Hamilton. From that period,
the whole character of Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> underwent a change: she was never seen
to smile, yet she never wept. Her griefs had left the heart, where
they operate to soften or to break, and seized the brain, where they
generate dreams of revenge, and frenzied illusions of the fancy. Her
blue eye now burnt with a sterner fire than even in her former fits of
anger she had ever exhibited; her demeanour, shewing fits and starts,
and a general disturbance of all her feelings, told, to the most
careless observer, that the change which had come over her extended
to the fountain of her feelings, and the springs of her hope. Her
usual sympathies seemed to be dried up, and nothing was left but the
simoom of a stern and deadly hatred, which shewed itself in sudden
exclamations, clenching of the hands, and wild looks. The report was
soon circulated, that Mary Lee was mad; but those who knew her better,
saw, in her strange conduct and demeanour, only the workings, on a
larger scale, of the same spirit which had been noticed by her father
at a very early period.</p>

<p>The rumours as to the intended marriage of Ashley were indeed true; and
they were soon followed by an announcement of a more certain nature,
that the marriage was to take place at “The Castle” within a month.
The intelligence reached the ears of Mary; but its effect was only to
add to the gloom which had apparently taken its eternal seat in her
countenance. She spoke to no one of the marriage, and gave no answer
when any question regarding it was proposed by the neighbours. Her
father, who had watched her conduct, and suspected an undue intimacy
between her and Ashley, conjectured the cause of the change that had
taken place on his child; but from his knowledge of her peculiar
temper, which had uniformly resisted every attempt to draw from her
her secrets, or to change the character and hue of her feelings,
he despaired of being able to acquire any proof of the reality of
his conjecture: so he followed the course suggested by his paternal
feelings, and endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> to soothe his daughter under her affliction,
and soften the obduracy of her apparent misanthropy. His efforts were
vain&mdash;the change on his daughter’s heart was as complete and lasting as
if it had been effected by an organic mal-disposition of its functions;
her looks, and short ejaculations of bitter scorn of the higher
sanctions of love or marriage, evinced a settled spirit of demoniac
frenzy; every indication proved the existence of that extraordinary
state of the female mind, produced by a deluded or scorned affection,
when the heart, instead of giving way to the revulsion of rejected
feeling, and breaking, secretes and nourishes a poison&mdash;like the saliva
of the serpent which has bit itself&mdash;destructive to the destroyer and
the victim.</p>

<p>On the day fixed for the marriage of Ashley, there were great
preparations made for rejoicings at “The Castle.” A dinner was prepared
for the tenents on the lawn, and all males and females residing on the
estate were invited to attend, to partake of the liberality of the
young laird, and wish him and his lady joy. An immense number of people
were collected, and the dinner was pronounced worthy of the spirit
of the young bridegroom. The repast being finished, the party were
regaled with drinks of various sorts; and Ashley and his bride came
down from “The Castle” to witness the gay scene. Then it was resolved
that the whole guests should rise with queghs in their hands, and drink
to the health and happiness of the young and handsome pair. This was
accordingly done; and the shouts of the boisterous labourers of the
land rent the welkin in honour of the toast. Ashley rose, as his guests
resumed their seats, and returned thanks for the kindness which had
been exhibited to him. He made large promises of reductions of rent,
when fate should be so unkind as to remove his father from this earthly
scene; and told them that the man who had never broken his pledge,
had that day a right to demand their faith and trust in a profession
which filled the hearts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> poor farmers with joy. These sentiments
were responded to by louder shouts, and a scene of joyous uproar was
exhibited which had never before been witnessed from the windows of
“The Castle.” Ashley sat down; and, nearly opposite to the place he
occupied, there was seen to rise a figure wrapped up in a cloak, as if
in the attitude of one intending to address the assembly. This person
was no other than Mary Lee. Pointing her finger over to Ashley, and
fixing her eye with the sternness of one determined not to be shaken
from a desperate purpose, she said, in a tone of voice which suited
itself with wonderful pathos to the style of her speech&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have waited for this, day, Robin-a-Ree, as I would have waited for
my ain wedding&mdash;and it has come. Ye are richt to believe this man, whom
ye have come to meet, and whase bread ye have broken, that he will
reduce your rents; for he never broke his word.”</p>

<p>Then there was a cry to put her down, accompanied by shouts&mdash;“We do
believe our excellent landlord.”</p>

<p>“So did I believe him,” continued she, “when I put my faith and troth
in his hands, and yielded to his desires, on condition o’ his promise
that I should stand in the place o’ this braw bride. That promise he
falsely broke; and will he keep that which he has this day made to ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” they shouted again.</p>

<p>“Never!” she screamed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> “Believe me, wha stand here a wretched victim
o’ his falsehood, whase love he sought and won, whase peace he has
destroyed, whase heart he tried to break&mdash;tried&mdash;ay, but only tried;
for he has changed it to the tongue o’ the harry adder that basks i’
the moss on the swamps o’ the Ken. I have hated the yellow-wamed ask
that sleeps i’ the mud o’ the lazy Nith, the moon-baying tyke, the
charking whutthroat, and the taed that carries its poison on its back
amang the seggs o’ the Solway. Ay, sair, sair, have I hated them, wi’
a’ the hate o’ a heart that had only twa pairts&mdash;ane for lovin’ and
ane for hatin’; but waur&mdash;ten thousand times waur, and tens o’ tens, do
I hate the vile and loathsome reptile, wha, puttin’ on the appearance
o’ man, and coverin’ his lyin’ tongue wi’ the Almighty’s words o’
promised faith, wiles frae the trustin’, lovin’, defenceless woman a’
that she has to care for on earth, and wha yet hasna courage enough to
stab her to the heart, and end her misery and her life thegither. But,
thanks to the power wha befriends the miserable, and brings oot o’ the
destroyed a spirit a thousand times stronger, to feed the heart which
love has betrayed!&mdash;sweeter to me&mdash;ay, hear me, hear the victim o your
worshipped idol&mdash;sweeter to me is that poison than would be to me his
kisses, now sour as the green bullister. But the day lengthens frae the
shortest to the longest, and, as the earth turns, they wha, but some
hours syne, stood upon oor heads, shall as mony hours after, lie under
our feet. So may the day o’ Mary Lee’s joy follow the nicht o’ her
grief&mdash;and that joy will be revenge!”</p>

<p>As the last word, “revenge,” (says our legend) rang round the silent
scene, the excited damsel waved her hand and disappeared. The effect of
her speech was electric. Every one looked at his neighbour, mutterings
and whisperings ran round the company, and glances of a suspicious
nature were thrown upon Ashley. Some of his friends, for the sake of
saving him, suggested that the woman was insane; and the company,
glad to find a pretext for disbelieving the charge brought in so
extraordinary a manner against their landlord, adopted the suggestion.
Ashley, however, was struck deeper than he would avow, or than might
have been expected, in the case of a man dead to ordinary pity, and to
the moral sense. Rising from his seat, he again thanked the company for
their attention, and retired.</p>

<p>Next day a messenger called at the house of Mary’s father, and
requested to see her. He was commissioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> he said, to give
her&mdash;provided she would receive it with grace and favour&mdash;renouncing
the ill-will she bore to Ashley&mdash;a considerable sum of money, amounting
to two hundred merks. Contrary to the man’s own expectation, the girl
seized the money with the greatest avidity; but without uttering a
syllable wherefrom he might draw an inference that she was placated in
any degree by the gift. As soon as he retired, she locked the money in
her trunk, apostrophising the despised and worshipped dust, with the
spirit of an enraptured Mammon&mdash;“Lie there till vengeance needs ye.”</p>

<p>Time rolled on without producing any change on Mary Lee. At “The
Castle,” things were different. The old man died, and Robert succeeded
to the estates. He gradually softened down to the condition of a
sober-minded husband, and experienced the ordinary effects of early
ribaldry and dissipation, in a deep, heart-felt regret, and a wish to
make amends to heaven and earth for an abuse of the gifts of both. He
had one son, whose name was Hector, whom he loved with all the devotion
of a father. Being an only son, the boy was, as usual, spoiled, both by
his father and mother; having concentrated on himself affections which,
in other circumstances, might have been, with advantage to parents and
child, spread over a family of sons and daughters. To such an extent
was affection carried, in the case of this spoiled child, that the
mother would scarcely let him out of her sight. With his heart also
garnered up in his son, and happy in the possession of a kind, gentle,
though constitutionally weak wife, Robert Ashley might have been
pronounced as happy as the regret produced by the loss of the best part
of his life would permit him to be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as regarded the victim of his seduction, Ashley conceived he
had now little to fear, seeing she had received his peace-offering, and
had, it was reported, contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> an intimacy with Hans Gerstendorf,
a German smuggler, who had been in the practice of running his good
frau, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unsere Mutter</i>, an old lugger, into the port of Fairhaven, with
contraband goods. The report was, to a certain extent, true. Hans had
conceived an affection for the still beautiful Mary, and it was certain
that she had, in some degree, unbent her stern misanthropy in favour
of the German, though with what aim, or for what object, the gossips
of Fairhaven knew not. It was not without credence among some, that
Hans, whose appearance justified the suspicion, had used some unlawful
means&mdash;and fancy supplied German charms&mdash;to open the heart which all
supposed shut against human efforts. Speculation, however, might rack
itself with curiosity&mdash;Mary’s attentions to the foreigner remained
unaccounted for. She often visited his craft, and this supplied others,
less indulgent, with the idea that the German charm was nothing else
than good Hollands; yet those who knew Mary Lee better ridiculed the
suspicion as unworthy of her character; for her sobriety, in the midst
of her unearthly feelings, was never questioned. One thing, amidst all
this doubt, remained certain, and that was that, whatever favour Hans
Gerstendorf had in the eyes of the relentless fair one, no other person
ever saw her smile, and few heard her speak. The same gloomy melancholy
haunted her, the same bitterness of scorn of all social relations, was
observable in her eye, and trembled on her lip.</p>

<p>On a day, a horseman, well-mounted, arrived in Fairhaven, in a state
of breathless anxiety and haste. He called for a number of the
fishermen of the village, and requested them to fly with him to the
Fisher’s Cairn, a mile beyond the village, to give them assistance
in searching for the body of Hector Ashley, who, he said, had fallen
into the Solway, and was supposed to have perished. Then the fishermen
seized their dead drags, and ran with their greatest speed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> the
place pointed out. On arriving there, they found a number of persons
collected, among whom was Robert Ashley, apparently occupied in
searching for the body of the drowned youth. The clothes of the boy
lay on the top of the cairn, from whence it was supposed and reported
that he had been bathing, at that part of the Solway which was full
of dangerous eddies, and had perished. The father stood in a state
bordering on despair, witnessing the unavailable efforts, on the part
of the people, to recover his son. Every exertion was used&mdash;the dead
drags applied in every direction&mdash;and the fatal announcement made,
that the body was irrecoverable. The tide was receding, and it was the
opinion of the fishermen, that the body must have been carried, by the
eddies, into some of the deep clefts of the rock, from which it was,
in all likelihood, impossible to extricate it. The people gradually
disappeared, with the exception of one or two, who undertook to wait
the receding of the tide; and Robert Ashley, the disconsolate parent,
was conveyed home, in a state of insensibility, to witness the second
grief of a mother wailing for the loss of her only child. As the
carriage which conveyed Ashley home passed through the village, Mary
Lee was sitting, in her usual melancholy mood, at her father’s door. On
observing the crowd, she suddenly started up, and, with a loud laugh,
pointed to Ashley, and retreated into the house. The circumstance
caught the attention of the crowd, and formed a part of the melancholy
theme which fate had supplied to the evening gossips of Fairhaven. Some
hours afterwards, it was reported that the tide had receded to its
utmost extent, and no trace could be found of the lost heir of “The
Castle.”</p>

<p>The conduct of Mary Lee had given rise to suspicions of her being
in some way, connected with the death of Hector Ashley; and an
investigation was, by the orders of the father, set about, with the
view of ascertaining what grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> there existed for these suspicions.
It was, however, clearly ascertained that Mary Lee had not been out
of her father’s house for hours preceding the disappearance of the
unfortunate boy, and the inquiry was relinquished. No hope was now
entertained that any less disastrous fate had befallen him than being
drowned, while in the act of bathing, a recreation he had been in the
habit of indulging in unknown to his mother, who had enjoined the
strictest prohibition against it.</p>

<p>The effect of this calamity, on the mind of Mrs Ashley, was such as
to produce strong apprehensions of the most dangerous consequences.
No consolation could be administered to her with the slightest chance
of abating a grief which had sunk too deep for human aid to relieve.
After some months, it was discovered that a hereditary tendency to
consumption had received a fatal increase of strength, from the decayed
state of her constitution; and the disease having progressed with that
rapidity so often observed to be one of its most appalling symptoms,
the bereaved mother breathed her last in the arms of the fate-stricken
and inconsolable husband.</p>

<p>It was on a rainy day, in December, that the remains of Mrs Ashley
were to be conveyed to her father’s vault, a few miles distant from
“The Castle;” a large cavalcade of mourners attended; the funeral
was conducted with a state and pomposity suited to the rank of the
deceased; the procession glided silently along, by a road passing
through the dark forests of “The Castle,” and by that spot where the
unhappy victim of Ashley’s perfidy resigned her honour and her peace
for ever. The trysting-tree was still there, with its branches bending
under a load of December snows, which the thaw had not yet been able
to dissolve. There Mary Lee took her station; and, as the mournful
procession passed, the woods resounded with the same wild laugh that
had met the ear of Ashley, on the disappearance of his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Years rolled on, but the bereaved husband and father finds little
assuasive power in the effects of time. Robert Ashley experienced this
melancholy truth, and sought assistance from a fountain, the perennial
consolations of which flow over the hearts of the rich and the poor.
The extraordinary manner in which the early victim of his heartless
seduction had triumphed over his misfortunes, appeared to him as the
supernatural effect of Divine retribution. The idea haunted him like
the invertible companions of Orestes. A deep melancholy took possession
of his spirits, and made its usual inroads upon a constitution which
early vices and unprecedented bereavements had made susceptible of
the despoiling ravages of disease. His mind became occupied with a
presentiment that the death of every member of his family would alone
atone for the ruin he had brought on that individual, whose fate seemed
to have constituted her an avenger of wrongs, only to be expiated by
the greatest of misfortunes, visited on the head of him who had blasted
the prospects of one of God’s creatures, and expelled his victim from
the sanctuary of grace.</p>

<p>It was in these states of bodily disease and mental dejection, that
the proud lord of “The Castle” was brought to feel not only what it is
to be a man, but a sinner. He felt how vain were all the advantages
of fortune when they are not accompanied by peace of mind. The woods
around the Castle used to afford him a retreat from the fevered
excitements of gay life. The song of the blackbird, full, mellow, and
sorrowful, soothed the ear which had been poisoned by the flatteries
incident to favoured sons of fortune. The merry <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</i> of the lark
banished unpleasant recollections; many a sigh was drowned in the rich
flow of the music of the thrush. All these things were experienced with
joy and satisfaction, when the silent energies of health and youth
made his muscular limbs jump with the exuberance of animal spirits.
They were welcomed as good tidings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> when no pang of aroused conscience
stung him with its peculiar pain, and no morbid fancy made to dance in
the green woods the images of misery he had brought on the hearts of
unsuspecting victims.</p>

<p>Now, all was changed when he rode out in those beautiful retreats&mdash;the
pleasure he formerly derived from them was the parent of the evil
he now felt. The contrast was itself a grievous pain; he would have
been happier in the abodes of sorrow. Pleasure is not the soother of
griefs, that ask the nourishment of a morbid appetite for an accession
of woe. It is a cataplasm applied to a sore, under the mistaken idea
that its softness will atone for the pungency produced, not from its
own asperity, but the tenderness of the part diseased. The joys of “The
Castle” were now dead to its lord. If the soothing influences of rural
scenery, with its rough hills and soft valleys; its trees, plants,
flowers, and tuneful birds, could not assuage the pangs of a diseased
body, a bereaved heart, and an awakened conscience&mdash;what could be
expected from the entertainments of the Castle? Ashley knew too well
the vanity of these, even in the heyday of youth, health, and pleasure,
to have recourse to them when his views were blasted, and his hopes
had fallen. All company he avoided; and no attempt, on the part of the
surrounding gentry, or his old friends, was available in getting him
to relax the rigid discipline of sorrow which he had, in his despair,
imposed on himself.</p>

<p>As he rode out, for the benefit of the air, he was always under an
apprehension. Vague fears, the result of an evil conscience, haunted
him. The rustle of a leaf disturbed him, and the slouching, fearful
look he threw on intruders on his solitary walk, were in sad contrast
with the proud bearing of the once eagle-eyed lord of the proudest
castle on the western marches. His timidity rendered him incapable of
managing his horse&mdash;a proud creature, which vindicated the untainted
character of its stock, under the crestfallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> demeanour of its once
haughty master. In going over a small fence, he one day fell into an
old ditch, and the weakness to which he was reduced prevented him from
rising. In this condition, Mary Lee, in one of her wandering fits, came
upon him.</p>

<p>“I wish ye joy,” she commenced, “o’ the elevated position ye occupy in
the heart o’ yer ain wuds.”</p>

<p>“Away, woman!” cried Ashley, “art thou not already avenged?” and,
trying to raise himself, he fell back with his eye still fixed on the
fury.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “he who exalteth himself shall be debased, and he
who humbleth himself shall be raised. Ye have lang inhabited a proud
castle; but fate, wha richts the oppressed, can mak the craven-hearted,
dastardly betrayer o’ woman’s troth, lie whar the meg-o’-mony-feet
crawls, and the green and yellow carrion courts the slimy mouth o’ the
adder. A short distance frae this, ye lay wi’ me on a green bank, whar
roses encircled us wi’ their sweet-scented flavours, and poured into my
credulous ear the poison o’ your love. A stagnant ditch now contains
your diseased body, and the hisses o’ the vengeance o’ a ruined woman
pierce and wound the ear that was ance charmed wi’ her honied love.”</p>

<p>She paused, as if to gloat her eyes with the writhings of her
victim&mdash;then resumed:</p>

<p>“Twice have I lauched o’er your misfortunes; a third opportunity has
gratified a heart only prevented frae breaking by the wish I hae lang
nourished, to see the auld taff o’ the kirkyard cover the moil that
will keep ye frae the sicht o’ her ye hae ruined. Mary Lee has naething
now but the wishes o’ a revengeful heart, and this spittle she throws
on the reptile that stung her honour, and made her fame bleed and
perish, to show that a woman is no without a part o’ that power that is
vouchsafed to the trampled worm.”</p>

<p>As the infuriated creature finished these words, she spat on the
poor victim of her hatred, now unable even to reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> to her dreadful
expressions of a morbid thirst for revenge. Having thus gratified
her passion, she disappeared among the woods. Ashley lay for a
considerable time, before assistance came to him. His feelings may be
conceived&mdash;they cannot be expressed. His conscience was enough for him,
without the exhibition of so deadly a hatred in her whom he now pitied.
The reaction of injured virtue overcame him. He groaned in the depth of
his agony; burning tears of remorse flowed down his cheeks; the pains
and penalties of vice stung him in mind and body, with the malignity of
demons; he would have given the proud domains of his forefathers, for
one drop of mercy to his burning soul. He tried to pray; he was unable.
The fiends still clung to him. The Almighty did not think it time to
pluck them away. In his struggles, he fainted, and lay on the cold
earth for several hours.</p>

<p>The servants of the Castle came out to seek their master. They
searched the woods, and found the horse which had strayed away from
him. His groans attracted their notice; and, in the plight we have
described, they found their unhappy lord. When taken home, he was
put to bed, where he lay for some months. The aids of ministers of
religion afforded him consolation, but were ineffectual in banishing
the presentiment which had taken so firm a hold of his imagination.
They recommended to him travel; and he consented to remove to France,
where the change of scene might produce its accustomed effects, in
withdrawing his mind from the contemplation of a subject which preyed
on his vitals. Arrangements were made for the journey, and everything
was ready for his departure; but the journey which was destined for the
unhappy victim of his own crimes, was of a different kind from that he
had in view. On the day on which he was to depart, he was seized with a
hæmorrhage from the lungs, and died before any medical advice could be
afforded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moonlight night, some weeks after the interment, Mary Lee stood
upon the grave of Robert Ashley.</p>

<p>“The proud Eagle,” she soliloquized, “wha condescended to come to earth
only for garbage, now lies whar I have lang wished him to be. Robert
Ashley has met his deserts, an’ nae tear has wet the cheek o’ Mary
Lee. Na&mdash;that tear shall only be the clammy rheum that oozes frae the
closing ee o’ death, and only maks the cheek o’ the heart-broken mair
dry. Did I no say, that I hated the connach worm? Ay, but I, wha have
nae love for mortal on earth, could love that creature now, for it will
nestle in the heart o’ my destroyer e’en whar I have nestled. Fear nae
guile now, ye brawnet reptile&mdash;that was a’ wasted in my ruin; an’ bluid
will be your repast as it has been my vengeance. Thrice have I lauched
in triumph; an’ I would lauch my loud lauch again, if Robin’s ears war
open to hear’t; but I have yet anither victim, and my last shout shall
be o’er the fate o’ the remainin’ rafter o’ the ruif tree o’ the auld
Castle. Then shall be the weird o’ my hatred fulfilled, and the staff
o’ the stern wizard, wha guides me on through the dark ways o’ revenge,
be broken an’ cast on the waters of the Solway.”</p>

<p>As Mary was in the act of pronouncing the last words of her speech,
she was interrupted by a voice, apparently that of a man. It was
Gerstendorf, who had not been in these parts for many years. He seemed
in great agitation, and spoke confusedly, and as if in fear of being
overheard.</p>

<p>“What brings ye here, man, wi’ that craven look, and these broken
sounds?” inquired Mary.</p>

<p>“What may that be to you, mein gut child? Donner! have I no power left
to look after mein safety, and by returning the knabe, Hector Ashley,
to the house of his vater, get a riddence of the outlawry against me
and mein crew?”</p>

<p>“Hans Gerstendorf,” replied Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> “is this the faith pledged to me
langsyne, when I put into your hand twa hunder siller merks, as the
apprentice fee o’ Hector Ashley, and the reward o’ eternal silence as
to his birth and lineage? This may be German troth, but it belangs na
to the honour o’ Galloway.”</p>

<p>“The faith, and the promise, and the covenant,” replied the German,
“belong to the men who live under the laws&mdash;Teufel! are not the sharks
and the hounds, by the sea and by the land, smelling for us and baying
for us?&mdash;and doesna the hang-tief stand on the lang sands o’ Leith to
mak langer, by twa inches, the craigs o’ the pirate and his gang? Ha!
mein gut Maria, what is the troth to the life, the breath, and the soul
that kensna repentance for ten thousand crimes?&mdash;One chance is left,
and that is, to tell Peter Fleming the secret o’ his parentage, and his
history, from that day when I kidnapped him at the Fisherman’s Cairn,
and left his cla’es on the stones to beguile his father. Once in the
Castle and we are safe.”</p>

<p>The resolution, intention, or wish, thus expressed by the German,
deeply affected Mary. For some time she replied not&mdash;her hand was on
her forehead, and she was apparently musing in deep thought; at last
she started.</p>

<p>“Weel, weel,” she said, in a choked voice&mdash;“weel, since it is as ye
say, that your lives are in danger, let your way be as ye wish. But
whar are ye concealed?”</p>

<p>And, as she put the question, her eye watched the looks of the German.</p>

<p>“My men are amang the high bent that grows on the drifted sand, twa
miles doun the coast. But wha is now the proprietor o’ ‘The Castle?’
for I maun tell Peter the name of the man wha is to be his enemy; and
we may hae to fecht our way to head-quarters.”</p>

<p>“There is naebody in the House,” answered Mary.</p>

<p>“Blut! that is the good tidings,” ejaculated Hans, in joy. “Hurra,
then, for the Castle!” And he dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> through the willows that overhung
the burial-ground, where they stood.</p>

<p>On that night, three hours after, intelligence was said to have been
given by Mary Lee to the procurator-fiscal of the stewartry, that the
outlawed pirates lay in the sea bent at the banks of the Solway. A band
of armed men repaired to the place, and Hans Gerstendorf and his men,
among whom was Peter Fleming, no other than Hector Ashley, were seized
and put in irons, and carried to the jail of Dumfries. The unhappy
men were afterwards removed to the jail of Edinburgh, tried, and four
of them, including Fleming, condemned to be executed on the sands of
Leith, for the crime of piracy on the high seas. They were executed
accordingly.</p>

<p>A new family came to occupy “The Castle”&mdash;far removed in
relationship to the Ashleys. Mary Lee continued to live on, for many
years, exhibiting the same peculiarities of character&mdash;the same
silence&mdash;the same scorn of social relations. Her desire of revenge
was satisfied&mdash;but that satisfaction was no more effectual, in its
assuaging consequences, than revenge is generally found to be. It
even added to her moroseness; for the evil which she had removed, had
been the only good she ever enjoyed, and the thirst for revenge which
she had indulged, when slaked by the blood of all her enemies, left
her nothing to wish for in the world. She took no interest in passing
events, and as she increased in years, her faculties decayed. Latterly,
and towards the termination of her life, she fell into temporary fits
of insanity&mdash;which, however, did not conceal from her all her sorrows,
for her lucid intervals were periods of misery; all her recollections
seemed painful as the searing-iron of a roused conscience; she never
displayed a symptom of remorse for the dreadful vengeance she had taken
on the head and house of her seducer; but the wild laugh would break
out only to settle again in the stare of idiotcy. So much for our
legend.</p>

<h2>THE LORD OF HERMITAGE.</h2>


<p>Great was the surprise of the peaceful congregation assembled in
the little church of Ettleton, in Liddisdale, on a Sunday forenoon,
somewhere about one hundred and fifty years since, to see the Lord
of Hermitage come in amongst them, just as the service of the day
had begun. A surprise this, not without good and sufficient cause;
for, although the patron of the parish, and living in the immediate
neighbourhood of the church just named, the Lord of Hermitage had not
entered it for many a long year. Some of those present thought it not
unlikely, that he had begun to repent of his ways, which were, indeed,
evil&mdash;for a vicious, dissolute, and tyrannical man was he&mdash;dreaded and
detested by all who knew him; and that his coming to church, on this
occasion, was not improbably meant as a public intimation of his having
commenced the work of reformation; and that it might, therefore, be
looked upon as the first overt act of contrition. Others, incredulous
of so sudden a conversion in a man so notorious for his wickedness,
dreaded that his appearance, on this occasion, boded no good; although
they could not conjecture, either, how any evil should arise from it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while all eyes were fixed on him, the dreaded Lord
of Hermitage, slightly bowing to the officiating clergyman, took a
seat and seemed to listen for some time, with decent attention, to
his discourse. But it was only for a short time that he continued to
exhibit this becoming respect for the devotional proceedings that
were going forward. His eye was soon observed wandering over the
assembly, as if in search of some object, and was at length seen
fixed, with a steady and insolent gaze, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> beautiful countenance
of Isabella Foster, the daughter of a respectable farmer, and one of
his own tenants, who resided in the lower part of Liddisdale. In this
circumstance, simple as it was, or rather would have been, but for the
well-known character of the Lord of Hermitage, some of the congregation
felt assured that they had discovered the secret of his appearance
amongst them on this occasion, while all considered it matter for
strong suspicion of evil intentions.</p>

<p>Isabella Foster was, on this occasion, accompanied by her father and
her acknowledged lover&mdash;a young man of considerable property, but who
was, nevertheless, much better known in the country by the familiar,
Border-like soubriquet of “Jock o’ the Syde,” than by his real name,
which was Armstrong. Isabella herself marked, and she did so with fear
and trembling, the ominous gaze of the unprincipled Lord of Hermitage;
and she clung closer and closer to her father and her lover, both of
whom were also aware of the circumstance at which she was so much
alarmed. Her father saw it with a feeling of dread and horror; for
he knew well the infamous character of the man, and he knew, too,
that he would perpetrate any villany, and have recourse, without the
smallest hesitation or compunction, to any measures, however violent or
atrocious, to accomplish the gratification of his passions; and he felt
how vain would be all his precautions, how <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original read 'nnavailing'">unavailing</ins> all the means he
could employ, to defeat the designs of a man at once so determined, so
unprincipled, and so powerful.</p>

<p>On her lover, however, the discovery that his Isabella had attracted
the special notice of the Lord of Hermitage had a different effect. It
roused his young blood; and in the look with which he contemplated him,
as he gazed upon her, there was plainly to be read a proud defiance at
once of his personal prowess and his power. Armstrong felt, at that
moment, that his single arm, furnished with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> good sword, was
alone sufficient to protect his lover from all the Lords of Hermitage
that ever existed, although they all came upon him in a bundle.</p>

<p>With more experience of the world, Isabella’s father, as we have shown,
thought and reasoned differently. He feared the worst; and these fears
were much increased when, on the dismissal of the congregation, the
Lord of Hermitage rode up to him, complimented him on the beauty of
his daughter, and he told him that he meant to do himself the pleasure
of paying him a visit soon, when he hoped, he said&mdash;at the same
time turning towards and bowing to Isabella&mdash;that the fair Lily of
Liddisdale would not be absent.</p>

<p>Isabella’s father made no further reply to this remark, than by bowing
politely, and saying, with equivocal hospitality, that his house should
always be open to the Lord of Hermitage.</p>

<p>Isabella’s lover, who was also of the party on this occasion,
mechanically felt for the hilt of his sword, while this conversation
was passing&mdash;a motion which did not escape the notice of him who had
excited such an evidence of hostile feeling; neither did the stern
look, with which he contemplated the speaker, pass unobserved.</p>

<p>“What chafes thee so much, young man?” said the Lord of Hermitage,
turning to the person whom he addressed, with a contemptuous smile. “Is
yon fair maiden your sweetheart, my flint-spark; and are you afraid I
shall run away with her?”</p>

<p>“No names, if you please, my Lord Hermitage,” replied Armstrong; “I
take no by-names but one&mdash;that by which everybody knows me. All others
I am apt to acknowledge in a way that is pretty generally allowed to
be disagreeable. And as to this lady being my sweetheart,” he went
on&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>“perhaps she is, and perhaps not; but whether she be or no, should
you entertain any thoughts of running away with her, take my word for
it&mdash;take the word of ‘Jock o the Syde’&mdash;that you’ll run pretty fast,
and pretty far, too, if I don’t overtake you.”</p>

<p>To this blunt language, the Lord of Hermitage merely replied, evidently
desirous of giving the whole matter the turn of a joke, “that he was
glad to find the young lady had such a redoubtable guardian.” Having
said this, and made his obeisance to Isabella, bowed to her father, and
waved his hand slightly and coldly to Armstrong, the Lord of Hermitage
rode off towards his own residence, whither we shall take the liberty
of accompanying him.</p>

<p>On entering the gate of his castle, the Lord of Hermitage was met by a
person who seemed to be a retainer&mdash;for such his dress bespoke him; but
there was a familiarity in his manner, mingled with a sort of careless
respect, that at once shewed that his lord and he were upon a much more
intimate footing than is usually displayed between master and servant.</p>

<p>“Well, my lord,” said this person, as he assisted his master to
dismount, “have you seen her?”</p>

<p>“I have, Maxwell,” replied the Lord of Hermitage; “and, on my soul, a
most lovely creature it is. Strange that I should not have heard of her
before. Thou hast an admirable taste, Maxwell,” he went on; “and I owe
thee something for this scent, which thou shalt forthwith have. ’Tis
a rare prize, Maxwell, I assure thee, and does thy diligence infinite
credit.”</p>

<p>“I guessed as much,” replied the person addressed, and who was, if such
an official can be recognised, the confidential villain of the Lord of
Hermitage, in the shape of a domestic servant or personal attendant&mdash;“I
guessed as much, my lord,” he said, with a fiendish smile; “I felt
assured that I had at last caught something worth looking at.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation dropped for a time. The Lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> Hermitage being
now dismounted from his horse, proceeded into the castle, whither he
was followed by Maxwell; when the two, having shut themselves up in a
small retired apartment, resumed the discourse which the movement just
spoken of had interrupted; and proceeded to discuss the question as to
which was the best method of getting Isabella Foster into their power.</p>

<p>“Carry her off, to be sure&mdash;carry her off bodily,” was the reply of
Maxwell to this query&mdash;“why should there be any hesitation?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, Maxwell,” replied the Lord of Hermitage, musingly.
“It would make a stir in the country, and set the fools a-talking. I’d
rather it were quietly done, if at all possible. I have told Foster,”
he added, after a pause of some minutes, “that I would pay him a visit
one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Then, my lord, excuse me, you were wrong,” said Maxwell, interrupting
him&mdash;“you were wrong. He’ll bundle the girl out of the way directly;
and, if he does, we may look long enough ere we find her again.”</p>

<p>“Faith! I dare say, thou’rt right, Maxwell,” replied the Lord of
Hermitage; “although I scarcely think the scoundrel would dare to do
that either. I should have a right to consider such a proceeding as a
personal insult, and feel myself warranted in resenting it accordingly.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt, my lord,” said Maxwell; “but, in the meantime,
observe you, the girl may be gone&mdash;a loss, this, for which the
satisfaction of running her father through the body, would be but an
indifferent compensation.”</p>

<p>“Right again, Maxwell, right again,” replied his master; “why, then,
suppose after all, we do the thing boldly and at once.” A proposition,
this, which ended in an arrangement that the Lord of Hermitage,
accompanied by Maxwell, and other three or four trusty knaves, well
armed with concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> weapons, should, on the following day, set out
for Foster’s residence, and, seizing a fit opportunity, carry off his
daughter.</p>

<p>On the day following, accordingly, a party of five horsemen were seen,
towards evening, riding up the avenue, at the head of which Foster’s
house was situated; when the latter, having observed them approaching,
and recognising the Lord of Hermitage amongst them, hastened out to
receive them. On their coming up&mdash;</p>

<p>“I promised you a visit, Foster,” said the leader of the party, at the
same time flinging himself from his horse; “and I am now come to redeem
my promise.”</p>

<p>Foster made no reply, but bowed and requested his visitor to walk in,
an invitation with which he immediately complied; but when a similar
one was extended to his followers, they, one and all, declined, saying
that their master intended staying so short a time, that it was not
worth their while dismounting&mdash;an apology with which Foster was, at the
time, satisfied, although some circumstances soon afterwards occurred
that made him doubt its sincerity. One of them was, his observing two
of the horsemen who <em>had</em> dismounted, notwithstanding what they had
said just a moment before, skulking about the door of the apartment in
which he and his guest were.</p>

<p>After the latter had sat for some time, and had partaken of some
refreshment that had been introduced, he inquired of his entertainer,
with affected carelessness, what had become of his “fair daughter.”
Foster replied that she was unwell, and confined to her own apartment;
which was, indeed, true.</p>

<p>“Unwell!” exclaimed his guest, starting to his feet; “you do not say
so! Ha! unwell!&mdash;I must see her, then. Perhaps I may be able to restore
her to health. I have some skill in the healing art. Come, Foster,”
he added, with a sudden ferocity and determination of manner, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
contrasted strongly with the benevolent purpose he affected, “conduct
me to her this instant&mdash;this instant, I say, Foster.” And he drew a
sword from beneath the cloak in which he was enveloped.</p>

<p>“What means this conduct, my lord?” inquired his amazed and alarmed
host.</p>

<p>“Mean, sirrah! mean!” replied the Lord of Hermitage&mdash;“why, it means
that I am about to do your daughter an honour.” And, without waiting
for the guidance he had demanded, he rushed out of the apartment&mdash;when
he was instantly joined by two of his followers, with drawn swords
in their hands&mdash;and proceeded to search for the chamber in which the
object of his villany was confined. Having quickly found the apartment,
the ruffians, after in vain soliciting admittance from its inmate, whom
the previous noise had alarmed, began to force the doors. While they
were thus employed, Foster, who had, in the meantime, armed himself,
and brought two or three of his men to his assistance, suddenly
rushed in amongst the assailants, and a close and sanguinary contest
immediately ensued.</p>

<p>At this moment, the unfortunate young lady, hearing her father’s voice
raised in anger, and the clashing of swords in the passage which led to
her apartment, undid the door, and frantically rushed into the midst
of the conflict. Fatal indiscretion! She had scarcely stepped from her
room, when the thrust of a sword (not, however, meant for her) reached
her heart, and she fell, lifeless, amongst the feet of the combatants.</p>

<p>In a few seconds afterwards, her unhappy father also fell, mortally
wounded; when the fiends, perceiving the purposes of their villany
thus fearfully frustrated, instantly quitted the house, mounted their
horses, and fled.</p>

<p>This new atrocity of the Lord of Hermitage&mdash;for he had been guilty of
many, although, perhaps, this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> most hideous of all&mdash;excited,
when it became known, such a universal feeling of horror throughout the
country, that the miscreant, powerful as he was, was obliged to fly the
kingdom, and betake himself to a foreign land, to avoid the popular
vengeance with which he was threatened. But his crime was of too deep a
dye to escape due punishment, even on earth. There was one whose fierce
and enduring thirst for revenge he could not evade&mdash;one to escape whom
all his windings and doublings were vain, and from whose arm, neither
distance of place or time could ultimately protect him.</p>

<p>On hearing of the dreadful catastrophe, Isabella’s lover, Armstrong,
vowed he would have a deadly revenge, and that he would never cease
from the pursuit of the Lord of Hermitage, while both remained in life,
till he had accomplished his destruction; and, in pursuance of this
oath (which he swore on the grave of his lover), he abandoned home and
friends, assumed the habit of a palmer, and set out in quest of the
murderer of Isabella Foster and her father.</p>

<p>On leaving the country, the infamous Lord of Hermitage directed his
steps to London, where he remained for some time in concealment; for
the singular atrocity of his crime, which he had no doubt would soon
be known far and wide, made him consider himself unsafe, even in the
heart of the English capital; and unsafe, even here, he certainly
was, although unaware of the particular character of the danger that
threatened him; for Armstrong had traced him, and he only escaped him
by the chance circumstance of his leaving London for the Continent,
one single day before his pursuer had discovered his retreat. Similar
fortuitous circumstances saved him, at various subsequent terms in the
chase; but the bloodhound that tracked him, though often thrown out,
kept steadily to his purpose, and as often regained as he lost the
scent of his victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>For two full years, the lover of Isabella Foster pursued her murderer
with unabated eagerness and unflagging zeal; and, for two full years,
the former, from various accidental circumstances, escaped the
vengeance that was thus, although unknown to him, so closely pursuing
him.</p>

<p>At the expiry of these two years, however, the Lord of Hermitage,
guided, in some measure, we suppose, by a similar instinct with that
which directs the hare back to her form, however wide and numerous
may have been the evolutions of her intermediate career, sought his
own castle again; entertaining also, doubtless, a hope that his
atrocious crime, though it could not possibly be forgotten, would
now be contemplated with less intensity of feeling than on its first
occurrence.</p>

<p>It was on a dark and stormy night in November, that he arrived at
his own gate on horseback, and alone. Their lord’s return being
wholly unexpected by his domestics, he had some difficulty in gaining
admittance; but having at length satisfied the porter who kept the
gate, that he was indeed his master, the former was thrown open; and,
all dripping with wet, and perishing with cold, the Lord of Hermitage
once more entered his own castle, where, in the enjoyment of the
luxuries of a blazing fire and an ample repast, he quickly forgot the
sufferings to which, for the last ten or twelve hours, he had been
exposed.</p>

<p>In little more than an hour afterwards, however, the Lord of
Hermitage’s arrival was followed by that of another person, who rode
furiously up to the gate, and inquired, in an eager and anxious tone,
if he had yet appeared. Being answered in the affirmative, the stranger
called on the porter to open the gate, saying that he was an attendant
of his master’s, whom the latter had hired some days previously, and
that he had lost both him and his way in the dark, being a stranger in
that part of the country. The man’s story was plausible; and he was
instantly admitted. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> entering the court-yard, and seeing some lights
in the windows that overlooked it, the stranger inquired of the person
who admitted him, whether any one, and which of these windows belonged
to his master’s sleeping apartment. The porter, naturally thinking that
the question was put by the stranger with the view of affording his
master his services, pointed out the apartment he inquired after, and
gave him particular directions how to find it. Desiring his informant
now to hold his horse for a few minutes, till he should have informed
his master of his arrival, when he would return, he said, to take
charge of the animal himself, the stranger disappeared. In an instant
after, the door of the Lord of Hermitage’s apartment was suddenly
opened, and “Jock o’ the Syde” stood before its horror-struck inmate,
who at once guessed the intentions of the intruder. What followed was
the work of a moment. Armstrong&mdash;his eyes dilated with a fearful joy,
and with a deadly smile playing on his haggard countenance, seized the
unhappy Lord of Hermitage by the throat; and, as he struck a dagger to
his heart, exclaimed&mdash;“Villain! most atrocious of villains! the hour
of vengeance is come. I have caught thee at last. This, and this, and
this,” he said, as he repeated his stabs, “is for Isabella Foster and
her murdered father!”</p>

<p>Elated beyond bounds at this successful termination to all his weary
toils and watchings, and gratified to think that his vengeance had
been, after all, consummated in the very stronghold of the murderer,
Armstrong flew to the court-yard, leaped on his horse, and having
called to the porter, in a voice of fierce exultation, to open the
gate, as his master had ordered him on a pressing and important
mission, “Jock o’ the Syde” galloped out of the castle; and his loud
and triumphant, but most appalling laugh, as he cleared the gate-way,
rang wildly through the darkness and solitude of the night, and struck
those who heard it with awe and dismay; for it was, indeed, unearthly.</p>

<h2>GLEANINGS OF THE COVENANT.</h2>

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;KINALDY.</h3>


<p>Kinaldy is now the property of Mr Purves&mdash;an excellent country
gentleman who has made an ample fortune in America; but the period to
which my narrative refers, was long prior to this. The property is
poor and moorish though now covered with wood, sheltered, and highly
cultivated. In the days of Andrew Watson, it bore a very different
appearance: in fact, Andrew was not the proprietor, but only the
farmer; whilst a nephew of Archbishop Sharp, long resident in an
asylum, was the nominal proprietor, under various trustees, of whom the
famous Archbishop was one.</p>

<p>Farm houses in those days were very different from those of the
present. A thatched and patched roof, with walls of alternate layers
of turf and stone, and mid-walls or hallens of clay and straw, quite
Egyptian manufacture, were all the go; and if any one, more advanced
and uppish than his neighbours, got the length of a stone and clay
wall, with a wooden partition within, he was deemed uncommonly
appointed, as times went. Through these stone and turf walls there was
free ingress and egress to the wind, as well as a plentiful allotment
of rats, and the light infantry, the mice; and holes capable of
admitting even the cat in full chase of her prey, perforated the clayey
hallen in particular. Thus, by little and little, the frail separation
betwixt but and ben&mdash;the house and the cha’mer&mdash;was in a manner
undermined; and even the pressure of a little urchin’s elbow, of eight
or ten years of age, was sufficient to shake it to its foundation. It
is of one such as I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> describing, that the author of Maggy Lauder
speaks, when he makes his jolly heroine contemptuously exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Begone ye hallenshauker,”</span><br />
</p>

<p>in other words, ye puir contemptible body, whom no respectable person
will permit to advance further into their house than the hallen,
against which ye loiter and lean till it shakes.</p>

<p>The fire, in these times, occupied, like the sun, the centre of the
system, around which, at various distances, revolved, the Venus
guidwife, the Mars guidman, the Juno Jenny, the Jupiter Jock, the
Saturn Sandy, and a vast number of satellites, in the shape of
half-clad, bare-footed, uncombed, squalling brats. Pocket handkerchiefs
there were none; but coat-sleeves and petticoat tails did just as well;
and though the Kenley Burn ran past, pure and pellucid, its waters
were seldom defiled&mdash;unless perhaps, on a church-going Sunday&mdash;with
the ablution of hands and faces. There was a byre covered with heath,
and with rafters fixed in the earth, without the advantage of walls,
from which issued, in their season, cows, stirks, and calves, all
covered over, like the Dacians, in scaly armour, rattling as they went
in hardened shairn, and sometimes carrying a considerable fragment of
the door-head of their cabin along with them; ducks swattered in a
Glenburnie midden dub; and an assortment of hens, over whom presided
a most dignified cock in full feather, giving an air of extreme
liveliness and stir to the whole. But although the outside of things
was, comparatively with modern manners and improvements, somewhat rude
and forbidding, there were warm hearts and tender consciences within.
There literature was indeed but limited; but, limited as it was, it
comprehended the Bible, the Confession of Faith, and “Knox’s History of
the Church of Scotland.” Well acquainted was Andrew Watson, and so was
his wife, Janet Morrison, with the grievous defections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> and oppressions
of the times. And never did Andrew bend his knees in family worship,
but he prayed the Lord in behoof of the poor persecuted remnant, of the
good and faithful Mr Alexander Wilson, the ousted minister of Cameron,
and of a’ those that opposed Prelacy and conformity, and supported
Presbytery, in thae sairly afflicted lands.</p>

<p>It was half-past one o’clock, on as beautiful a 3rd of May as ever
burst, in glory and in song, upon the kingdom of Fife, in the year of
grace 1679, when Peggy Watson&mdash;a girl about fourteen years of age, and
daughter to the above-mentioned Andrew&mdash;entered her father’s door in a
dreadful state of affright. It was some time before the poor girl could
be brought to utter any coherent sounds at all; at last, she said that
she and Tam Cargill, a neighbour’s boy had been amusing themselves in
seeking for birds’ nests on Drumcarrow Craig, when she saw a number
of men on horseback gathered round the tall ash tree, at the farm of
Magus. By and by, a gentleman’s servant passed them on horseback, and
then a fine coach appeared, drawn by six horses. When the coach passed
(she said), the men under the tree set off at full gallop after it; and
she heard firing, and loud speaking, and saw the coach overtaken, and
stopped, and a man dragged out of it, and shot at, and murdered&mdash;she
was quite sure that he was murdered. Thereupon, Tam Cargill had run
off homewards in one direction, and she in another; for she was afraid
the dreadful men might look up at Drumcarrow Craig, and murder her
and her companion too. This narrative caused a great sensation in the
family, and Andrew was at a loss how to understand it; for, although
the archbishop’s treachery and cruelty were well known in the country,
yet the more immediate object of popular detestation was Mr William
Carmichael, sheriff-substitute of Fife, from whose hornings, and
finings, and distrainings, and quarterings of a rapacious and sensual
soldiery, scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> any one individual, unconnected with the prelatic
faction, had been excepted. Nothing farther occurred till about ten
o’clock at night, when all the family had been summoned around a
peat-fire, on a sandstone hearth, to family prayers. There were in all
ten individuals, comprehending the lad, the lass, six bairns, of whom
Peggy was the oldest, with the guidman and the guidwife, worshipping
and nursing the youngest bairn at the same time. The dogs, which lay
scattered about at their ease and convenience, and which seemed,
hitherto, to be enjoying a comfortable repose, suddenly sprang to their
legs, and gave tongue vociferously.</p>

<p>“Hide me,” ejaculated a young man, stout and square built, and of a
somewhat prepossessing appearance. “O conceal me, honest Andrew Watson,
for the pursuer is close at my heels!”</p>

<p>The Bible was immediately laid aside, and the whole family gathered
round the strange intruder in the utmost consternation.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Andrew Watson, “and what has brought you about our
hallen like an ill-doer, at this time o’ the night, and in sic a
like manner. I wish ye haena been where ye sudna hae been, Mr George
Balfour, my man. Are na the bonny woods o’ Gilston, o’er by there,
sufficient to shelter the laird’s son in the hour o’ his difficulty and
need?”</p>

<p>“I canna gang hame at ony rate&mdash;I have just seen, frae my hiding-hole
in the Linns o’ Kenley, a whole band o’ soldiers scouring all over the
country, and bearing down upon Gilston direct.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;” Andrew was proceeding, when his well-known neighbour
entreated of him to act and not to talk, for a party of dragoons would,
in all probability, be at his door in a few seconds. What was to be
done? The children screamed at the idea of dragoons; the guidwife
wrung her hands, completely nonplussed; whilst Andrew, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> for
a moment, and ejaculating, “The son of the righteous father guilty or
not, must not be deserted in his need; he asks shelter and secrecy, and
he shall have both till morning, at least.” So saying, he conducted
Mr George Balfour privately to a small barn immediately adjoining,
and filling an empty sack nearly half-full of straw, he thrust his
neighbour into it, bringing the straw up around his person and over his
head&mdash;there being a sufficiency of holes towards the fastenings at the
mouth of the sack, by which respiration could be effected, and even
vision partially obtained. Having done this, Andrew placed the sack,
head uppermost, in a recumbent position, in the centre of several other
sacks filled apparently in a similar manner with grain. “There,” says
Andrew, “stand ye there till morning; and gin ye hear the door open,
and see armed men enter, beware of your breathing, for even that may
betray you.”</p>

<p>Mr George Balfour had been seen passing Den Head, after the affair
of the archbishop, and a herd callant had pointed his route out in
the direction of Kinaldy farm-house. Thus instructed, a company of
from ten to twelve dragoons surrounded the dwelling-house of Kinaldy
about twelve o’clock at night, and, breaking up the door without
any ceremony, proceeded immediately to search for the murderer. The
children&mdash;even to that in the cradle&mdash;were all turned out naked;
the cows were dislodged from their stakes, and set adrift in the
fields; two horses were unstabled; and the dung-hill fowls were sent
screaming and cackling from their perches in the byre. By and by,
the barn occupied their attention; and having made short work of
the door opening, they commenced cutting and thrusting with their
broadswords amongst some straw which occupied the further end. One
of the band laid his hand upon a sack, and finding that it contained
oats, he immediately called for assistance, and carried it out to the
adjoining field, emptying it immediately of its contents, and putting
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> horses to feed at will. Still the object of their pursuit was
invisible, and they become more and more infuriated; so, taking the
eldest girl, already mentioned, they questioned her, with their pistols
at her breast, respecting what she had seen or knew. Fortunately, the
girl was really ignorant, as was the whole family, except Andrew, of
the hiding-place of him they were in pursuit of; but, terror-stricken
as she was, she admitted that she had seen Mr George Balfour, whom she
knew, in the house that very evening.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said the leader of the troop&mdash;one of Carmichael’s
instruments of oppression&mdash;“we will make short work of it, Andrew;
either give up him we are in search of, or we will make a bonfire of
the hail bigging, and leave you and these naked savages to warm your
skins at the flames.” This they would actually have put into execution,
had not a horseman arrived at the critical moment with information
that Balfour of Burley had been traced to Dura Den, and that their
immediate presence was required to surround the retreat on all sides,
and capture the main instrument in the bloody transaction. A retreat
was thereupon immediately sounded, but not till Andrew Watson had been
assured that he, at least, should not escape, but that his property; if
not his person, should pay dearly for harbouring a murderer. With great
speed was the pass of Dura surrounded, and afterwards searched, even
to that cave in the steep face of the rock, part of which is visible,
immediately opposite to Yoolfield, even to this hour; but, if even
Balfour had taken refuge here, as is, from several circumstances, more
than probable, he had received warning in time, and had fled to Lanark,
in the west country. So the avengers of blood were too late for their
quarry, and were obliged to return to Cupar towards morning, with the
report of their total failure in capturing any of the offenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. George Balfour, younger of Gilston, escaped from
his durance, and, without saying to any one in what direction he meant
to retreat, escaped by Kenley Glen, from the old barn of Kinaldy.
That he went on board a ship at Elie, and immediately got off to the
Continent, was afterwards fully ascertained.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the poor family of Andrew Watson suffered most
severely. They were dragged up to the Sheriff-court at Cupar, and,
being examined on oath, were compelled to admit the concealment of
Mr. George Balfour; they pled, as was true, their ignorance of the
precise crime of which he had been guilty; for, although they might
suspect the nature of the crime from what the girl had witnessed, and
Mr. George himself had expressed, yet, no name had been mentioned by
either party, and the accused was entitled to plead the benefit of
ignorance on the main point. No matter; their goods were distrained by
orders of the infamous Carmichael, and they themselves turned adrift as
outlaws, to seek for shelter with the beasts of the field. Such doings
in those days were not uncommon, and scarcely dared any one to express
disapprobation, for fear of involving themselves in the same fate.</p>

<p>Houseless and homeless did Andrew Watson, his wife, and six
children&mdash;of whom Peggy, already mentioned, was the eldest&mdash;take their
way on the 15th day of May (old style), across the moors of Fife,
towards Auchtermuchty, where an uncle of Andrew’s kept a small public
house, and dealt a little in horse flesh. This uncle was a great
favourite of Carmichael’s, and one of the most active informers against
the non-conformists, and, in particular, against the murderers of the
Archbishop. All this was known to Andrew; but what was to be done;
he did not know where to turn himself; and, in the extremity of his
condition, was, in a manner, compelled to seek for refuge where he had
never hitherto placed any confidence. Wearied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> and worn out, the whole
family arrived at Norman Watson’s about sunset, and found his wife
at home, but not himself. Their piteous tale was told, and temporary
sustenance rather grudgingly afforded, when Norman arrived himself&mdash;his
face dreadfully flushed with drink and rage, and in words and with acts
anything but friendly&mdash;he insisted upon their immediately leaving his
threshold. His wife, though somewhat inclined to mercy and hospitality,
was manifestly the slave of her husband’s temper, and she offered no
resistance.</p>

<p>“O man!” exclaimed Andrew Watson, whilst he gathered up his weary
limbs, and beckoned to his wife to nurse her child ere they
departed&mdash;“O Norman, but ye are a hard-hearted man, and totally
destitute of natural feelings! But the Lord will provide, in his own
good way, for me and mine; whilst you, wha persecuted his chosen flock,
shall be reduced, ay, to want and beggary.” This last expression
touched old Norman even to frenzy; and he even lifted up the handle of
a horse whip, which he had in his hand, to strike down his nephew with.</p>

<p>“Come on, man!&mdash;come on!” said Andrew. “Strike down and murder your
brothers bairn, and send <em>her</em> there husbandless and <em>them</em> there
fatherless, into the woods of Falkland; but ye canna strike down the
uplifted arm of Him who now sees you, and who one day will reward the
sinner according to his deeds. But shall e’en mak ye free of us.” And
thus saying, he left the house, followed by a sobbing wife, and five
weeping and screaming children. They wandered forth, in the dusk of
a beautiful evening, into the woods of Falkland, and, sitting down
under the shelter of a large oak tree, Andrew Watson proceeded to give
out from memory, the 121st Psalm, which was sung by the whole family,
with the exception of the child at the breast. It is impossible to
conceive a more appropriate exercise in such a locality than this.
The twin Lomonts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> rose to a considerable height above them. The moon
had just taken possession of the southern sky, and looked mildly and
benevolently down upon their sylvan resting-place. The sun had set
in glory, and his beams yet lingered on the nor’-western sky. The
air was warm, and the grass was dry, soft, and matted&mdash;the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tenaci
gramine</i>” of Horace. Before proceeding to conclude with prayer, and in
consideration that they would not see to read a chapter from the small
pocket Bible which had been spared to them, Andrew gave the following
commentary on the psalm which had just been sung:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘I to the hills will lift mine eyes,’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, there they lift their heads before us, the beautiful work of
God&mdash;the twin Lomonts of His own creation!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘From whence doth come mine aid.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“O Lord of Hosts! do thou descend here as thou didst on Sinai and
Horeb, and aid thy poor, wandering, houseless servants; for the aid and
protection of man I have not; and unless thou leavest thy heavens and
comest down, I and the wife of my bosom, and my poor little ones, must
perish.”</p>

<p>Hereupon the voice of lamentation was heard; but it was suddenly
repressed by Andrew springing to his feet, and repeating with great
emphasis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘My safety cometh from the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who Heaven and Earth hath made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon by night thee shall not smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the sun by day.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“So we will e’en go to rest in the confidence of the fulfilment of His
gracious promise.”</p>

<p>And, having prayed fervently, and placed the younger ones in each
other’s arms, they laid themselves down and fell asleep. They must have
slept long and soundly, for the sun was more than an hour risen, when
a staghound was seen licking the face of Andrew Watson as he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> his
family lay in the woods of Falkland: in fact, Lord Crawfurd had left,
that morning, his residence at Struthers, in the parish of Ceres, and
had pursued a fallow deer, with “hound and horn,” into Falkland forest.
The hounds had been taken off the scent by the unusual finding of a
covey, as it were, of human beings beneath a tree, and sleeping in
the open air; so this naturally excited observation, and his lordship
himself, with several attendants, immediately rode up to the spot. The
Earls of Crawfurd, from time immemorial, were distinguished not less by
their high and noble descent, than by their princely bearing and kindly
feeling; besides, they had all along aided the Reformation from its
opening, and supported Presbytery against the inroads of Prelacy. The
mournful story was told and listened to. A horseman was called upon,
and dismissed on a secret errand, and the family were directed to make
the best of their way to Struthers&mdash;the Fife residence of his lordship.
An ample breakfast with the housekeeper awaited their arrival; and they
were told after breakfast, that as his lordship’s <i>hen-wife</i> had died
suddenly&mdash;a few days before&mdash;and no new appointment had been made,
Andrew Watson should possess the lodge, which she formerly occupied at
the gate. And whilst he looked after the gate, and a few black-faced
sheep which were kept, for table use, in an adjoining park, his wife
should take the management of the poultry.</p>

<p>Thus ended the trials of Andrew Watson, who lived to see his uncle
bankrupt, turned out of house and hold, and carried to his grave, with
scarcely a mourning attendant, in consequence of his own acts. Truly,</p>

<p>

<h3>XIX.&mdash;THE TRIALS OF THE REV. SAMUEL AUSTIN.</h3>

<p>Amongst the oldest recollections which I have, is my attendance,
along with my mother, at the dispensation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> Sacrament of the
Lord’s Supper, in the parish of Penpont, Dumfriesshire. Mr Keyden
officiated at that time as parish minister, and was known through
all the adjoining parishes, and, in particular, in my native parish
of Closeburn, as a most able, eloquent, and popular preacher.
Consequently, whenever the occasion came round, as it did regularly
about the middle of June&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The roads war filled frae side to side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wi’ mony a weary body,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">In droves that day.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Morton boated the Nith at the Boat-pool, and poured <em>in</em> her hundreds;
Closeburn took the water at the nearest, with stilts, horses, and
carts; Kier was completely deserted. Penpont emptied her wooded and
sequestered glens of all that could wield a staff, or kilt a petticoat;
even the more remote Keir Glencairn, and Dunsmore, sent their
contributions of sacrament hunters. There they all congregated on the
green slope of the manse, looking towards the sunny south. The Scaur
sent her ample waters dancing and sparkling on the saugh tree, and
the willows saw themselves reflected from her pools; whilst the stony
banks murmured under the gentle salute of the stream. The tent stood
with its back to the south, and the scorching sun; whilst a forest of
faces fronted in an opposite direction. The whole scene was at once so
imposing and picturesque, that it has established itself indelibly in
my brain. A bald-headed little person, with spectacles, mounts the tent
stair or ladder from behind; he takes off and thumbs his eye-glasses;
whilst his soul is complacently abroad over the communion-tables,
covered with napery&mdash;bleached white as the driven snow, on the very
green where it is now spread. It was on one of these occasions that I
heard Mr Keyden, in his <em>after</em> address to the communicants, express
himself in nearly the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>“My friends and fellow-communicants, the ground which you now occupy
is hallowed&mdash;it is holy. On this very spot did your forefathers meet,
to hear the good, the pious, the persecuted Mr Samuel Austin&mdash;him
whom the lawless hands of wicked men banished, with all he held dear,
to the cave, and the moss, and the mountain. O Creehope! that now
re-echoest to thy peaceful waters, what a tale thou couldst unfold of
Austin’s nightly watchings, and prayer, and praises. O Queensberry,
that rearest thy proud and double front to the very breast of heaven,
have not thy long heath and deep morasses hid the servants of God when
the pursuer was near at hand! O water! pure and peaceful water of
Scaur, that now stealest along as if unwilling to disturb our present
doings and meditation, thou didst hear him groan&mdash;thou didst mark his
tears, and those of his deeply afflicted wife and family, on the day
when his trial had come, and was not over; but now the servant of the
Lord hath gone home to the house of his father. He and his are now
around the throne, reaping, and greatly enjoying the reward of all
their sufferings&mdash;the noble, the everlasting recompence of reward.
He whom Lag pursued, and Douglas hunted, and Johnstone cursed with
words of wicked and self-condemning import, is now following the
Lamb whithersoever he goeth&mdash;yes, my friends, far and away, beyond
that white cloud, which now comes betwixt heaven’s sun and us; far
and away in the unfathomed depths of eternity&mdash;unmeasured fields of
immensity&mdash;there dwell&mdash;there dwell&mdash;he and his. They are clothed in
white, because they are worthy; and they cease not, night nor day,
giving glory to Him that sits upon the throne. Go ye, my dear brethren,
and do likewise; serve your God like him, through ill as well as good
report, in adversity as well as prosperity, and the like reward will be
yours.” My youthful feelings were naturally excited by this very, very
powerful address, in consequence of which, on my way homewards, I laid
my mother under contribution to the whole extent of her traditional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
information on the subject. This information has been, since that
period, considerably increased by a perusal of a MS. diary lent me by
the late worthy minister of Keir, Mr James Keyden, whose father&mdash;the
minister of Penpont, already referred to&mdash;had found it, along with some
other papers, in an old barrel in the manse garret. I cannot speak
positively, but my impression is (and the present minister of Penpont,
Mr Smith, will correct me if I am wrong), that this little roll of torn
and soiled papers is lodged in the hands of the presbytery clerk, and
may still be verified by actual inspection. From these diaries, the
following narrative, true in all its leading facts, is composed.</p>

<p>Samuel Austin was a native of Closeburn, and born, apparently, about
the year 1600. His father was a shepherd on the farm of Auchincairn;
and the son was educated in a great measure by an uncle, who had seen
a little service, having served as a soldier till the civil wars made
him glad to retire on a small allowance, which the Government of the
time had made to him. This person happened to be not only a soldier
but a saint&mdash;that is, one who, in the language of the day, sought his
God frequently and earnestly in prayer and supplication at a throne of
mercy. He had, besides, been well-educated for the times in which he
lived, and took special care that his young name-son, Samuel, should be
benefited by his superior information, as well as by his genuine and
ever-fervent piety. He would walk out with the boy of a summer evening;
and, having caught his attention, and gained his good-will by short
and striking narratives of his own adventures “by flood and field,” he
would take him to the top of that immense heap of stones from which the
farm manifestly has its appellation, and, pointing to the magnificent
prospect around, raise the young spirit from earth to heaven&mdash;from
the visible to the invisible&mdash;from the external work to the internal
agent. He would then talk of God’s visible church on earth, of the
Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> and the reformers; of the burnings and slayings, and
torturings for conscience’ sake; and of the efforts which had more
recently been made to maintain beloved Presbytery in Scotland in
particular. All this was accompanied by Bible and historical readings.
It was then that young Samuel Austin grew up under his uncle’s tuition,
without ever having entered a school door. When the boy was verging
towards the man, he became every day more and more attached to the
cause of liberty and Presbytery; and, at his uncle’s expense, was
educated (according to the limited and imperfect usage of the times)
for the church. When only twenty years of age, his learning and piety
gained him an unanimous call from the adjoining parish of Penpont,
where, at the period to which my narrative more particularly refers, he
had laboured successfully and most acceptably for many years. In the
meantime, his good friend, his uncle, had died, as also his parents;
whilst a blind girl, his only sister, had come to live with him at the
manse. About twelve months after his settlement, he married. For many
years after Samuel Austin became minister of Penpont, all seems to have
gone on well. I find his settlement noticed in the diary referred to
in the following terms:&mdash;“16th September, 16&mdash;. This day I have been
solemnly inducted into the pastoral charge of many souls. Lord, what am
I or my father’s house, that thou shouldst honour me thus!”</p>

<p>Though re-instated on his throne, principally, by the Scottish
Presbyterians, through the agency and address of the famous General
Monk, and notwithstanding his having more than once sworn to the famous
National League and Covenant, yet no sooner was Charles the Second,
of infamous and treacherous memory, fairly established on the throne,
than, yielding to the interested suggestions of intriguing and selfish
counsellors, and to those of the arch-traitor Sharp, in particular, did
this monarch set about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> establishing Prelacy in Scotland as well as in
England, under the agency of Middleton and Lauderdale. By them, Sharp,
Fairful, Wishart, Sydserff, Mitchel, Hamilton, Wallace, Fletcher,
Haliburton, Forbes, Paterson, M’Kenzie, and Leighton, were ordered to
be consecrated, and sent down to Scotland, with the titles of Bishop
and Archbishop, to take their seats as an Estate in the Scottish
Parliament and to forbid all induction into benefices, unless by the
imposition of the prelates’ hands. This was immediately and extensively
remonstrated against by Synods and Presbyteries, as well as by lay
and clerical individuals, throughout Scotland in general, but more
particularly throughout the countries south of the Forth and Clyde. It
was throwing up, in spirit at least, all that their ancestors had been
contending for, even unto the death by <em>fire</em>, for more than 150 years,
and was, at the same time, submitting to an illegal and arbitrary
adjustment of star-chambers and councils. With Presbytery was there all
along entwined and commingled political freedom and equal law; and the
Covenanters of the year 1662 saw full well, that if they sacrificed
the one, they must likewise surrender the other. It was about this
time, that, on account of Mr Austin’s neglect of obtaining conformation
or induction of the then Bishop of Galloway, within whose diocese
Penpont lay, he received a summons ordering him to appear incontinently
before Bishop Hamilton (brother to Lord Belhaven), to answer for his
contumacious neglect. As Mr Austin had originally been inducted and
ordained, according to the rules of the Presbyterian Church, he did not
feel himself at liberty to obey the bishop’s mandate.</p>

<p>Some time after this, the family of Mr Austin were placed in
circumstances of a very trying nature. William Austin, an only son,
and now a probationer of great promise and talents, had long been
threatened with that fatal complaint which smiles whilst it drinks
dry the well-springs of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> And sore and seriously did the alarmed
and affectionate mother plead with her husband to satisfy the bishop,
submit to a renewed presentation from Douglas of Queensberry, the
lay patron, and thus reclaim his manse and stipend undisturbed and
undisputed. But Samuel Austin was not to be diverted from his line of
conceived duty, even by the most tender ties of the heart.</p>

<p>It was on a keen, frosty Saturday morning, in the month of January,
whilst all the surrounding hills were covered with snow, and the pools,
ponds, and lochs with ice, that the family of the manse were convened
in the little parlour, and engaged in family worship, which was, as had
been usual for some time, conducted by the young probationer, William;
for although the fatal disease had not yet impaired his faculties, or
very greatly reduced his strength, its presence was still manifest
by the hectic spot in the cheek and the nightly fever. William had
been selected as the future choice of a neighbouring congregation,
should they be permitted to make their own selection; but the state
of his health had made it manifest to all that his Master had not so
determined. Whilst William was upon his knees (after having sung the
psalm and read the chapter), pouring forth, in extempore and fervent
expression, the feelings of himself and of his fellow-worshippers to
the common and true God, through the one common and only Saviour, the
door was rudely assailed, and ultimately forced open, and in came the
harsh and bearded countenance of the afterwards notorious General
Dalziell of Binns,<a name="Anchor-1_1" id="Anchor-1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to Footnote 1">[1]</a> accompanied by a band of well accoutred dragoons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<p>“What have we here?” exclaimed the exasperated and really astonished
intruder&mdash;giving, at the same time, the person engaged in prayer a rude
push with his bootless foot<a name="Anchor-2_2" id="Anchor-2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to Footnote 2">[2]</a>&mdash;“what have we got here?” addressing
himself to one of the troop of the name of Johnston. “Why, here we have
the whole batch&mdash;man, mistress, and maid&mdash;seeking Cromwell’s corkskrew.
Come, have done with your canting and grunting, young one&mdash;up and be
doing, thou old hoary traitor&mdash;clear up these blinkers, bonny Betty
Blossom, for I have a message, in which ye are all somewhat concerned,
from his Majesty, King Charles, God bless him! and his curse be on all
his enemies. What! not grunt or growl an amen! Old Sam, I say, I have a
polite message here from his Majesty’s Lord Chancellor, at the instance
of my Lord Hamilton, Bishop of Galloway, to warn, denounce, and declare
you a runnigate traitor, unless you shall, within eight days from and
after this date, bestir your stumps, and wait upon his Lordship, in his
palace at Whithorn; and there, and in that presence, receive and accept
of ordination as an Episcopal curate from his Lordship&mdash;having first
obtained a presentation to this living from the true and undisputed
patron, my Lord Douglas of Queensberry.”</p>

<p>“<em>That</em>,” ejaculated, instantly and firmly, the resolute and determined
servant of God&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>“<em>That</em> no power on earth nor under the earth&mdash;no
force of arms nor menace of look&mdash;no Laird of Binns nor Bishop of
Galloway&mdash;shall ever compel poor Samuel Austin, the honoured pastor of
a Presbyterian people, <em>to do</em>.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied General Dalziell, making use of an oath which it would
be fearful, as well as impious, to repeat, “off you shall budge, this
very day, hour, and instant, and betake yourselves&mdash;man, woman, and
boy, rag-tag and bobtail&mdash;from this here snug, comfortable manse,
to that there wide and roomy and northern county of Angus, far and
away beyond the river Tay&mdash;ay, and until my Lord Chancellor’s farther
pleasure be known respecting you.”</p>

<p>“O spare us!&mdash;O spare us!” exclaimed, or rather screamed, Mrs Austin,
running up to the fearful, long-bearded man, and clasping him round
the knees, weeping and wailing most dismally&mdash;“O spare us this once,
and all shall be done as you wish it. Yes&mdash;yes, Sam, my dear Samuel
Austin, you must just say the word&mdash;just say you will see about it&mdash;you
will think about it&mdash;you will ask the Lord’s advice about it&mdash;and maybe
these terrible men will leave us (the blind, ye see, sir, and the sick,
and the old and infirm) to finish our days&mdash;whar the feck o’ them hae
been spent&mdash;and to lay our banes in the auld kirkyard o’er by yonder.”</p>

<p>“Get up, woman, wi’ your yammering and blarney! D’ye think the King’s
officer does not know, and will not execute&mdash;ay, and to the letter&mdash;his
duty. Get up! and mak that auld hardened traitor say the one half that
ye hae done, and we shall soon rid you of our presence.”</p>

<p>“O Samuel&mdash;Samuel!” said the poor woman, rushing from the knees of the
captain to those of her husband, and ultimately, as she proceeded,
taking him around the neck, and looking into his firm and unchanged
countenance in the most imploring manner&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>“O Samuel! my own dear and
kind husband! the father of my dear and dying boy! the brother of that
helpless blind creature sitting greeting in the corner there! O Samuel
Austin, look at me! Don’t look away that gate; look in my face again,
whar ye said ye have often looked with pleasure. O look at me! look
at me! at your own Betty Sheils, <em>kindly</em>, and just say one word&mdash;one
single short word&mdash;yes! O say yes! at least do not say no; or we are
ruined, harried, driven, in frost and snow, at mid-winter, into the
mountains and the forests!”</p>

<p>“No more of this mummery!” exclaimed Dalziell. “Either promise, my old
boy, to do as your wiser half would have you, or, by all the broad
acres of Binns, ye do not lodge another night under the rooftree of
Penpont Manse&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>Hereupon the poor blind woman, who had all along been sobbing aloud
came rushing forward; and, catching hold of her brother’s hand, bathed
it in tears shed from beamless sockets, but remained silent. This
was indeed a trying hour to this good and affectionate man; and, for
a moment, his purpose seemed shaken, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original read 'aud'">and</ins> he looked around him, and
towards his son, who had hitherto remained a silent but interested
spectator of what was going on.</p>

<p>“O Willie, Willie!” at last exclaimed the poor heart-broken saint&mdash;“O
Willie! my son! my only child! what wouldst <em>thou</em> have thy father do?”</p>

<p>“I would have him,” responded the boy (as he was called in the
family)&mdash;“I would have him do his duty, and leave the rest to God.”</p>

<p>“Thou art right&mdash;thou art right, my child! Come to my arms! I did but
for an instant wish the cup to pass from me; but thou art more than
thy father’s child. Thou hast saved thine own soul, and mine besides;
and now, ye men of war, and of rapine, and of blood, come on; I am
prepared”&mdash;(looking to his son)&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>“we are prepared; do your worst. God,
who fed Elijah in the wilderness, will not permit the old, the blind,
alas! my child, I fear I may add the <em>dying</em>, to perish houseless and
helpless. We will rid ye of our presence this very day, and repair,
with all possible despatch, whithersoever the Lord willeth.”</p>

<p>Hereupon the poor mother fell down in a faint, and dropped into the
arms of her blind sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“Johnston,” said General Dalziell, “see these traitors unkenneled
before noonday’s sunset, lock the kirk and the manse doors, and bring
me the keys. March, my lads! We will be late for breakfast.”</p>

<p>So saying, the troop, with the exception of two, galloped off for
Drumlanrig, the seat of the Douglasses of Queensberry.</p>

<p>The following Sabbath was clear, cold, and frosty, and the ground where
the people met was dry, and free from snow. The crowd was immense;
many stood all day; some brought stools and benches; and an old fallen
ash-tree was completely occupied by human beings. The manse-family,
with some of the better classes, were accommodated under the tent;
whilst the young Laird of Closeburn (for which he was afterwards
severely fined) sat in the tent behind the speaker. In the papers of
this good man already mentioned, I find the following reflections
written manifestly on the eve of the Communion Sabbath:&mdash;“The Lord has
been very good and very gracious this day. Five hundred Presbyterian
believers partook this day of the bread of life. There was no hand to
help&mdash;no voice to rouse but mine, and that of my poor dying child. My
text&mdash;‘I will not leave you comfortless,’ John xiv. 18&mdash;afforded me
great openings of the spirit, and His blessed spirit was indeed upon me
this day in this great work; but my poor boy has laboured too hard in
preaching and in prayer.”</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the manse of Penpont was surrounded by carts and
waggons, and the plenishing of the minister was conveyed to several
places of safety in the parish, awaiting the return, if ever they
should arrive, of better times. The weather was exceedingly stormy;
and, to attempt an immediate journey through the Lauder Hills, towards
the north, was altogether impossible. Yet whosoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> should harbour
this ousted family, under existing circumstances, would do so at
their own peril, as well as that of the proscribed individuals. When
the cart, borrowed from a kind neighbour, set out with the aged, the
blind, and the sick, there was one universal wailing heard from the
surrounding parishioners; nor did the procession separate, till they
had reached the <em>then</em> very small village of Thornhill, where the
poor, expatriated family had agreed to spend the first night in a
small public-house, till some ulterior measure could be resolved upon.
Poor William was immediately put to bed, for he was sadly exhausted by
the previous preaching and travel, as well as by that mental anxiety
which cuts through the body, as the sword does the scabbard. To remove
him in this state seemed impossible; and yet, to remain with him was
dangerous in the extreme; for Dalziell, accustomed to the massacre
of Turks and Russians, cared no more for life, or for sickness, than
for matters of the most ordinary interest! Accordingly, on the second
day, a detachment of soldiers was sent from Drumlanrig, with orders
to convey Samuel Austin, dead or alive, to his destined place of
banishment, beyond the Tay, to which place many of the non-conforming
ministers of the south of Scotland had already been removed. It was a
sad, sad parting for a father, who thought that he would never more
see his son alive, and for a son, who loved and valued his father’s
benediction over his last moments so highly; but there was no remedy;
and Mr Austin was marched off for Leadhills about ten o’clock in the
morning, accompanied by three rank and file well armed men. To paint
the separation is impossible; even the hard-hearted soldiers, inured
as they were to all Dalziell’s cruelties, were moved; but it was but
an involuntary and momentary feeling, which soon gave way to the
recollection of their strict and military order. Away they marched
onwards, slowly and with difficulty, by Carron Bridge and Durrisdeer.
At Durrisdeer they halted for refreshment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> and under some faint hope
of some means or other occurring to favour his escape, Austin supplied
the soldiers with a handsome sum to drink his health with, and he even
affected to become jovial on the occasion, and ultimately won that most
dangerous of all designations&mdash;“a good fellow.” One of the soldiers
became ultimately obstinate and quarrelsome, and swore that he would
march no farther that night. In vain did his companions remonstrate
with him&mdash;he swore he would shoot the first man that laid hold of him,
and fell suddenly fast asleep in his chair. The other two, though
considerably touched, were still determined to march up the Well Path,
and to reach Elwand foot that night. The Well Path is a narrow ravine,
which runs through the range of mountains which separate Nithsdale
from Clydesdale. The hills on either hand are high, and almost
perpendicular, and the pass beneath is rough and winding; in snow,
in particular, very difficult to keep, and very dangerous to miss.
Away, however, they marched; and, with great difficulty, contrived to
get to about the middle of the pass. By this time the day, or rather
evening, had darkened down, and the yird drift had become choaking and
perplexing. The path was covered over, and smoothed in with snow, and
beneath was a precipice of some hundreds of feet, a tumble over which
would probably be fatal. Austin was well acquainted with the pass, but
so were <em>not</em> the soldiers; and, having now reached the famous well
from which the path derives its name, they halted, and Austin drew out
from his pocket a bottle pretty well filled with brandy, which he had
secretly provided against accident at the inn. The men, in succession,
drew pretty copiously from this source of refreshment, till, at
last, fearing that they might fall fast asleep in the snow, and thus
perish, Mr Austin urged them to proceed. To this they still had reason
and prudence left to assent, and immediately pushed, recklessly and
speedily, through the snow; but, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> pushed in a wrong direction,
they instantly disappeared, the one catching hold of the other, and
both tumbling down the abyss.</p>

<p>It was about four o’clock in the morning, when the mother and blind
aunt were standing at the bedside of the dying lad. He had become very
rapidly worse since his father’s departure, and had occasionally been
delirious; calling aloud for his father&mdash;his dear father, without whom
he was unable to live. There was a small lamp or cruise burning on a
chest-lid by his bedside, and his mother sat at his head with a cup of
cold water, whilst the blind woman was rubbing his legs, which now,
alas! had begun to swell. The tempest howled without, and an unfeeling
landlord snored loudly and fitfully from a bed in the adjoining
chamber. All at once, William Austin became more composed, and began to
repeat various texts and psalms&mdash;discoursing from them&mdash;as his mother
said, <em>most beautifully</em>, and, ever and anon, declaring that this was
the last night he would ever see. All at once he paused&mdash;and, looking
fearfully wild, and forcing himself up from his pillow, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“My father&mdash;my father&mdash;my dear, persecuted father!”</p>

<p>His mother and aunt, whose faces were turned to his, imagined that
he had begun suddenly to rave, and tried to press him down on his
pillow, when the well-known voice of Samuel Austin was <em>indeed</em> heard
declaring&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is I&mdash;it is I, indeed!&mdash;your earthly, and real father, whom the
Lord has delivered, for this special purpose, from his enemies, that he
might see and bless his beloved boy, once more, ere he depart;” but,
alas&mdash;alas! laying hold of his son’s hand, and finding it cold, and, at
the same time, marking the fatal signal in the throat, “My boy&mdash;my boy
is gone&mdash;he is gone to his God! Let us pray.”</p>

<p>And, hereupon, he uttered the most composed and comforting prayer,
thanking his Maker for the loan&mdash;the pleasing loan; and expressing his
gratitude for the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> from the evil to come, which had just taken
place. Meanwhile, the mother and aunt had ascertained the truth of the
father’s averment, and were bathing the cold brow of the lovely boy
with their tears.</p>

<p>An explanation then took place; from which it appeared that, after the
soldiers had tumbled over the precipice, Mr Austin had made his way
backwards, with the view of seeing his beloved son once more before he
died, and of giving him a father’s blessing. The precipice, he said,
besides, over which the soldiers had tumbled, was so covered in with
snow, and so formed by nature, that he had little doubt but that they
would escape, with some bruises, perhaps, but with life. In these
circumstances, his adjourn at Thornhill would probably be short; as the
men would naturally infer that he would return, rather than advance,
in their absence. In the meantime, a coffin was prepared, and the body
was removed to Mortontown (a village now extinct), where a relation of
his, an uncle, tenanted a small farm from <em>the</em> Douglas of Drumlanrig.
This being closely adjoining to the kirkyard, the body was quietly
and secretly, during the second night after the decease, deposited in
the grave; and, much to the astonishment of his friends at the time,
another coffin was kept empty in the room beside him. His wife and
uncle having expressed their surprise at this, he disclosed to them his
plan, which was, to take possession of the box, with the suitable cover
over it, and other necessary precautions with regard to air, should
a search for him be made within a few days; and that, if necessary,
they should carry him out on spokes to the churchyard, through the
file of soldiers, as if it were his son’s body. As he had anticipated,
so it happened&mdash;the same three men who had accompanied him before,
assisted by a fourth, a sergeant, surrounded the dwelling, and passed
their swords, as usual, through everything piercable in the house;
swearing and roaring, and eating and drinking, all the while. The
coffin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> however, even <em>they</em> respected; and, having seen it conveyed
out of doors, and in the act of being carried towards the grave, they
uttered a horrible quartette of oaths and departed, determined to find
out the old fox in the old den&mdash;namely, at Penpont. Thus, by his own
forethought and sagacity, were these wicked men put upon a wrong scent;
and ultimately, broken and cashiered by their commanding officer, for a
criminal, and seemingly irremediable, neglect of duty.</p>

<p>Brownrig is now united with the adjoining farm of Mitchelslacks; but
it was, at this time, tenanted by a Mr Hunter, a predecessor of the
late distinguished Professor of Humanity, at St Andrew’s. This honest
man, Halbert Hunter, was a decided Covenanter; and had often walked
from ten to fifteen miles, of a Sabbath morning, to hear Mr Austin
preach. His residence was in the wildest division of the parish of
Closeburn, and very far removed from neighbours. Having heard of Mr
Austin’s misfortunes, Honest Hab&mdash;for by that name this worthy man
was familiarly known&mdash;set out westward, with the view of tracing out
Mr Austin’s retreat, and, at all risks, offering him a refuge in his
remote and obscure dwelling. But nobody could give him information;
and he was upon the point of returning home to Brownrig again, without
attaining the purpose, when, in passing Morton Manse, his horse, scared
at some clothes which were hanging, hard-frozen, and rattling in the
twilight wind, suddenly reared, and, throwing him off, he was severely
bruised, and carried into the farm of Mortontown, where Mr Austin was
actually lodged. Great care was at first taken to keep Mr Austin and
his family out of the way; but, as soon as old Halbert was recognized,
and his errand accertained, the Lord’s doing was instantly perceptible,
and the evening was spent in pious conversation and devotional exercise.</p>

<p>Next evening saw the whole party&mdash;minister, wife, and sister&mdash;conveyed,
not without some difficulty, to Brownrig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> This movement, however,
secret and guarded as it was, had not been unobserved by some of those
detestable informers, who, for hire, would have betrayed their own
fathers into the hands of a murderer; and, whilst Mr Austin was, next
day, addressing a number of young men and women, inhabitants of this
pastoral land, he was suddenly surrounded by a band of dragoons, and
captured without resistance. When his poor blind sister heard that her
brother was in the hands of his enemies, whose voices she heard, though
she could not see their persons, she rushed out in the direction of
the sound, in a frantic manner&mdash;calling aloud on the men to spare her
brother&mdash;her only stay in this world, when, ere any one could prevent
the accident, she tumbled over a steep precipice, upon the brink of
which, or nearly so, Brownrig farm-steading was, and is still, placed,
and, lighting upon her head, she was killed on the spot. Mr Austin,
seeing the danger in which his blind sister, unacquainted with the
locality, was placed, strove hard to disengage himself from the grasp
of the soldiers, who held him fast, but in vain; and, when he saw
the poor helpless being putting her last step upon air, he uttered a
scream, and bursting a bloodvessel, was with difficulty conveyed into
the house alive.</p>

<p>“Keep down your sticks, lads&mdash;keep down your sticks. That’s no the game
we are accustomed to play at; when we begin, cheeks and chaft blades
are apt to dance a Highland fling. Keep off your hands, or, by the
mettle of this old Ferrara, which never yet failed me against Turk or
Tartar, ye shall have fewer hands to keep off.” Thus saying, Dalziell
pushed up his horse, cutting right and left, in such a manner, however,
as to terrify rather than seriously to injure; for he struck with the
side and not with the edge of his weapon. In the meantime, Mr Austin
was put to bed; his wife had recovered to a perception of her misery;
and the cavalcade rode off, Dalziell having first appointed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> guard of
two men, to abide by the apparently dying man, till (as he expressed
it) the “deil had his soul fairly in tow.”</p>

<p>The day of the funeral of the poor maiden sister arrived, and with it
came, through snow and storm, a considerable band of mountaineers,
secretly armed with various weapons, but avowedly and openly prepared
to convey the coffin to a considerable distance&mdash;to Dulgarno
churchyard. The soldiers did everything in their power to annoy and
obstruct, offering to assist in carrying, and then suddenly withdrawing
their hands, and causing the coffin to fall to the ground&mdash;placing
their muskets betwixt the feet of some of the company, and thus
tripping up their heels, &amp;c., &amp;c. This was more than could be endured;
so, after the funeral, a consultation was held, and it was agreed that,
as Mr Austin was now considerably recovered, he and his wife should be
conveyed from beneath surveillance of these horrid men. But how was
this to be done? Many advices were tendered and discussed. At last,
it was resolved upon that, about twelve o’clock at night, information
having been previously given to the parties more immediately concerned,
a company of twelve stout shepherd lads, armed with pistols and staves,
should suddenly enter the door of Brownrig house, the bolt being
previously drawn from within, and immediately seize upon and bind the
twin demons, who had wrought, and were still working such dreadful
mischief and cruelty. The minister and his lady were to be conveyed,
through the snow, to the town of Moffat, about four miles distant,
there to be concealed in a friend’s house, to whom a messenger was
immediately despatched, advertising him of their purpose.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the hour appointed, and in the manner already
mentioned, the men were secured whilst asleep, and bound and guarded;
whilst Mr Austin, still incapable of walking, was conveyed on
horseback&mdash;with his wife behind him, and two men holding him up on each
side&mdash;over the long moor towards Moffat. It was about five o’clock in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> morning when the party arrived at its destination, and the flying
couple were placed for the time in a place of safety. Upon the return
of the young men to Brownrig, they found nothing but a heap of smoking
ruins. Dalziell, who had received information of the meditated flight,
but who had not learned in what direction it was to be conducted, came
about half an hour after their departure, upon the farm-steading of
Brownrig; and, not being able, on account of the yird-drift, to trace
the fugitives, he returned in wrath upon the inhabitants of the place,
whom, after exchanging a few shots, and wounding one man severely in
the leg, he ultimately captured; liberated the soldiers, and then,
in the presence of the whole party, coolly set fire to the thatched
dwellings, and kept close guard till the fire had done its commission.</p>

<p>Owing to the extreme cold and constant state of excitement, Mrs Austin
fevered soon after her arrival at Moffat, and died in her husband’s
arms, exhorting him, with her last breath, to persevere in the good
cause which he had undertaken; so much had “trial and trouble” altered
the views and sanctified the heart of this weak but upright and pious
woman.</p>

<p>Mr Austin continued to recover from his severe indisposition, and
spent some months at Moffat in comparative peace and safety. It was
here that he met with his brother-in-law, the worthy and beloved Mr
Shiels, minister of Kilbride. Indeed, all the ten ministers of the
Presbytery of Penpont, with the exception of Black of Closeburn, and
Wishart of Keir, had refused to conform, and, along with nearly four
hundred ministers in the south and west of Scotland in particular, had
been compelled to fly from their homes and their flocks, and were, in
many cases, conveyed in droves beyond the Tay; compelled to emigrate
to foreign lands, or to take up their abode with the curlews and gleds
of the lake and the mountain. It was indeed a sad day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> for Scotland
the 23rd of December, 16&mdash;, when, by Middleton’s drunken act of Privy
Council, so many conscientious and pious men were laid aside for so
long a time (many of them for ever), from their sphere of useful and
acceptable ministration in the Presbyterian church. As the faithful
historian of these dismal times very expressively observes&mdash;“When those
I am now speaking of took leave of their dear flocks, it was a day
not only of weeping but howling, like the weeping of Jazer, as when
a besieged city is sacked.” Mothers were seen carrying their infants
through snow and storm, and large families of children accompanying
their helpless parents with tears and lamentations to the cold and
often houseless desert. Whoever gave them food or shelter was liable
to be fined; to have soldiers billeted upon them; or even to suffer
imprisonment.</p>

<p>The leading persecutors being about this time principally engaged
about Wigton, Dalry, Dumfries (town), and other districts in the south
and west, the upper wards of Dumfriesshire were less annoyed, and
had more freedom of conventicle exercise. It was therefore deemed a
favourable opportunity&mdash;now that the month of July had arrived&mdash;to
hold a very general meeting, as privately as possible, on the confines
of Altrieve Lake&mdash;a locality which has since acquired considerable
notoriety from its having been the residence of one of the most
distinguished characters of more modern times. The reader knows that I
refer to James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, a more wonderful (perhaps)
instance of merit in a completely untaught man than even the case of
the comparatively early and well-educated and civilized Bard of Coila.
This situation was accordingly centrical and retired; elevated, and
yet surrounded by still higher eminences, and commanding the higher
districts or <i>moors</i> of the Yarrow, the Ettrick, the Tweed, and the
Annan. Mr Thomas Shiels was well-known to be a fit coadjutor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> the
worthy Mr Samuel Austin; and several people of what may be termed the
better class&mdash;the small lairds, and the moorland or sheep farmers&mdash;had
agreed to defray all expense of the communion elements, and to come
armed to the table, that their blood might not be mingled with their
sacrifice, without their making some resistance.</p>

<p>In the midst of a terrible storm of thunder, and lightning, and
hail, Mr Austin preached the action sermon, and Mr Shiels fenced the
tables&mdash;both serving the succeeding tables alternately. After the
storm had passed, the day cleared out, the mist left Mount Benger’s
brow, and sweet Bowhill looked out in soft and sparkling radiance. No
signal of an approaching enemy was made till all was over, and the two
officiating clergymen had returned with worthy Davie Dun&mdash;mentioned in
one of Hogg’s poems&mdash;to enjoy a night’s repose. He was then shepherd
on Mount Benger, and lived in a sheilin on the banks of Ettrick.
About daylight next morning the sheilin was surrounded by dragoons,
and Austin and his brother-in-law, Shiels, were dragged out of bed
and mounted together upon one horse, without a saddle, and their legs
tied together under its belly; and, in this painful and ignominious
state, driven across the mountains towards Peebles. When they arrived
there, poor Austin, who had not yet completely recovered from his late
indisposition, became so faint and weak that he could not sit, even
when supported by a dragoon at each side on horseback, and they were
compelled to lodge there for the night. Next morning, they were marched
off in the same manner, but with legs untied, towards Edinburgh, where
they were safely lodged in the Tolbooth. They were ultimately brought
before Lauderdale and the council; and after severe questioning,
dismissed into banishment, as was originally intended, into the shire
of Angus. Next day, they were conveyed over to Burntisland, and left
to make the best of their way across to Angus&mdash;being at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
informed, that if found south of the Tay, they would be taken up and
executed as traitors.</p>

<p>In Mr Austin’s note-book, I find the following notice with which I
shall conclude:&mdash;</p>

<p>“August, 1689.&mdash;It hath pleased the Lord to restore poor old useless
Samuel Austin to his people; but where are they?&mdash;twenty years have
made a sad event and reckoning here. The child has attained to manhood;
the man has disappeared, or labours under the infirmities of age;
and many have been removed, not only by death but by duty; they have
removed, in the course of God’s providence, to other parishes, and
even to other lands; and my flock is changed, and I feel no heart in
preaching to these new faces, who know not Joseph. O Lord, let me arise
and go hence; I am alone, in an altered world, of which I am weary.
My house is desolate; my child&mdash;my wife&mdash;my sister&mdash;all&mdash;all gone on
before; and fain, O, guid Lord, wad I follow&mdash;now let thy servant
depart and sleep in peace.”</p>

<p>In the kirkyard of Penpont, at the west end of the church, there is a
monument (at least there was, in my young days, some fifty years ago)
with the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div>

<h2>THE CURSE OF SCOTLAND.</h2>


<p>A night or two previous to the battle of Culloden, three or four
gentlemen, retainers of Prince Charles, and who were residing in the
same house with him at Inverness, were amusing themselves with a game
at cards. During the evening, one of the latter suddenly disappeared,
and, though anxiously sought for, could nowhere be found. “Curse the
card!” exclaimed one of the gentlemen impatiently, after looking for
it for some time in vain&mdash;“I wish it were in the Duke of Cumberland’s
throat.” The missing card was the nine of diamonds. The gentlemen,
however, determined not to be baulked of their sport, contrived a
substitute for the lost article, and played on till bed time.</p>

<p>Two days after this, the battle of Culloden was fought; and, as is well
known, the insurgent army was totally defeated, and the hopes of the
unfortunate Adventurer laid prostrate for ever.</p>

<p>One consequence of this event was, that Inverness was thrown open to
the Royalists, and thither, accordingly, the victorious general, the
Duke of Cumberland, directed his steps after the engagement.</p>

<p>It was a practice of the Duke’s, on arriving at any town or village
which had been previously visited by Charles, to inquire for the
house, nay, for the very apartment and bed he had occupied, and to
take possession of them for his own use, alleging, shrewdly enough,
as a reason for this conduct, that they were sure to be the best in
the place. In conformity with this practice, the Duke, on arriving at
Inverness, inquired for the house in which Charles had stopped; and it
being pointed out to him, he immediately took up his abode in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>On the day after the engagement, it was reported to the Duke, that a
great number of the wounded insurgents and others were still wandering,
or in concealment in the neighbourhood of the field of battle. The
ruthless general&mdash;whose naturally cruel disposition and sullen temper
seem to have been fearfully excited by the resistance he had met
with, and by the trouble it had cost him to subdue the rebellion in
Scotland&mdash;on being informed of this circumstance, gave instant orders
that a party of military should be sent out to destroy the unfortunate
men wherever they could be found.</p>

<p>A strong body of troops were accordingly immediately dispatched on this
sanguinary mission. But the officer in command of the party, after
proceeding some way on his dreadful errand, suddenly recollected that
he had no written authority for the horrible atrocity he was ordered to
see perpetrated, the commands of the Duke having been merely verbal.
Desirous of being better secured against any consequences which might
arise from the shocking proceeding in which he was about to be engaged,
he hastened back to Inverness, sought an audience of the Duke, and
respectfully requested him to give him his orders in writing.</p>

<p>“No occasion whatever,” said the Duke sternly, and somewhat irritated
at the want of confidence which the demand implied. “Do as you are
desired, sir. I’ll answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>The officer, however, continued to press his request, and reiterated
his desire to be put in possession of documentary evidence that what he
was about to do was done by authority.</p>

<p>Impatient at his importunity, and desirous of getting quit at once
of the subject and his pertinacious visiter, the Duke hurriedly
looked about the apartment for paper on which to write the desired
order; but he could see none. While looking for the paper, however,
he accidentally turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> up a corner of the carpet with his foot, and
brought to view a card which had been lying beneath it. The Duke
observing it, hastily stooped down and picked it up, exclaiming, as
he did so&mdash;“Oh, here, this will do well enough for the death-warrant
of a parcel of rebel scoundrels!” And he immediately wrote the fatal
order with a pencil on the back of the card. This card was the nine of
diamonds, the same which had been lost a few evenings before; and such
is one version, at any rate, of the tradition that has given to this
particular card the startling title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> “The Curse of Scotland.”</p>




<h2>LEAVES<br />
<small>FROM THE</small><br />
LIFE OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON.</h2>


<p>Every reader has heard of the infamous speculation which is still
known by the name of the South Sea Bubble. It produced a mania in
the mercantile world, and brought ruin and misery to the hearths
of thousands. Many who laid their head upon their pillow at night
believing themselves to be rich, awoke beggars in the morning.
Now, at the time when the South Sea scheme was at its height,
there resided in Newcastle a Mr Hamilton, who had come from the
neighbourhood of Peebles, when but a mere boy, as a clerk to a
merchant; but he possessed much of the caution, the sobriety, and the
prudence for which many of his countrymen are noted; and he not only
obtained the confidence of his employers, but rose to be an eminent
merchant himself. For more than thirty years he carried on business
prosperously; he was believed to be wealthy, and he was so. But he had
always been a speculative man, one whose temperament was too ardent,
and he entered into the South Sea project with his whole heart,
embarking in it his entire capital. He was a widower, and had an only
son, named Alexander, who, at the age of twenty-one, he took into
partnership with himself. The senior Mr Hamilton was a man who well
knew the painful labour attending self-teaching, for he had himself
experienced it; and, though he had always intended his son to be a
merchant, he had sent him to Cambridge for his education, saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> “A
British merchant is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: missing from scanned copy">a</ins> citizen of the world, and stands in greater need
of more languages than one, than a divine does. Therefore, my son
shall be a scholar.”</p>

<p>Alexander accordingly passed through his academical studies with credit
to himself; and, as has been said, when he had attained the age of
twenty-one, his father took him into partnership. But before he was
twenty-three he married Isabella Anderson, the daughter of a gentleman
who was then his father’s principal clerk, but who had himself been an
extensive merchant, until misfortune reduced him to the situation which
he then occupied. She was somewhat younger than Alexander; and although
a lovely girl, yet her virtues and the sweetness of her temper far
exceeded her personal attractions. The elder Mr Hamilton, being aware
of her many excellent qualities, though he knew her to be portionless,
was not averse to her marriage with his son. But they had not been
married twelve months, when the high-blown bubble burst, and the old
merchant found himself a beggar. He took it deeply to heart, and, in
the language of the mercantile world, he never raised his head again;
but he sat sighing and pining away, like a broken-hearted child, and
within six weeks he sank into the grave a ruined man.</p>

<p>Alexander, finding that the firm was indeed bankrupt, and that there
was but little prospect of his again succeeding in Newcastle, where
his pride revolted from becoming the servant of others, left his young
wife with her father, and proceeded to London, where he doubted not
but that amongst those who had received from his parent many thousands
of pounds, he should soon be enabled to obtain a situation which would
enable him to support himself and his Isabella in comfort.</p>

<p>His purse was, in truth, light when he arrived in the metropolis; and
having taken lodgings in a mean coffee-house in Ratcliffe Highway, he
despatched a note to a gentleman with whom they had dealt extensively,
and, without entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> into particulars, requested the loan of twenty
pounds. He wrote, because he was conscious that he had not the
assurance to solicit the favour personally; and he did solicit it,
knowing that, before he could obtain a situation in London, money
to support him in the interim was necessary. From that gentleman he
received an answer by the bearer of his own note, in which no notice
was taken of his father’s misfortunes or death; but the writer penned
his reply as though he were aware of neither, and expressed his regret
that, during the day, a circumstance occurred which deprived him of the
pleasure he should have felt in serving Mr Hamilton; and that he was
extremely sorry he could not then accommodate him with the trifle he
requested. He added, in continuance, that he supposed, from the place
from whence Mr Hamilton’s letter was dated, that his embarrassment
proceeded from some youthful frolic, and he considered that the best
method of discharging the debts of such creditors, was to give their
persons over to the power of the magistrates.</p>

<p>“Such, then,” exclaimed Alexander, tearing the letter in pieces, “such
is the friendship of this world!”</p>

<p>He was aware that the person to whom he had written was acquainted with
the ruined fortunes of his house; and it was gall to his spirit to find
that he not only wrote as if ignorant of them, but addressed him with
the unfeeling familiarity of cold politeness, attributing to the folly
of youth what he well knew to be the effect of misery and ruin.</p>

<p>He applied to another without obtaining any answer whatever; and the
third to whom he applied, having read his note, sent a verbal message
by the bearer, saying, “Tell Mr Hamilton that Mr &mdash;&mdash; is not at home.”</p>

<p>Indignant at the treatment of supposed friends, on the evening of the
second day he discharged his bill at the coffee-house (on doing which
he had but a few shillings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> left), and resolved to call personally upon
an old college associate who had been often obliged to him, and who
then was indebted to him more than a hundred pounds. This university
companion, after coming of age, had fitted up a house in a style of
absurd extravagance in Leicester Square.</p>

<p>I should have told you that, previous to Alexander’s proceeding to
London, he had been compelled to dispose of the best part of his
apparel to support his wife and himself, and, at the time we speak
of, his appearance was what ought to be termed <i>shabby genteel</i>. He
proceeded to the house of his friend, and striking upon the huge brass
knocker, in the absence of the porter, a pert little French valet, with
powdered hair, peeped cautiously from behind the door, and surveying
him with a glance of aversion and contempt, in which he no doubt set
him down to be a dun, he inquired&mdash;“Vat you vant, fellow?”</p>

<p>“The Honourable Edward Stafford, your master,” said Alexander, firmly.</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! ha! ha! ha!” said the little Gaul, and attempted to thrust
the door in his face; but Alexander, perceiving his intention, thrust
forth his hand with a force that made the door fly back upon its
hinges, and caused the huge brass knocker to sound an unusual and
unceremonious alarm through the house, and at the same time drove the
little powdered piece of foreign impertinence upon his back at the
further end of the lobby.</p>

<p>“Moorder! moorder!” shouted the little valet, sprawling upon his
back, and kicking with his feet upon the floor, till kitchen-maids,
housekeeper, cook, butler, and all the personages in the Honourable
Edward Stafford’s establishment, came rushing around him, holding up
their hands.</p>

<p>“<em>O sacra Marie!</em>” cried the little valet, as they raised him to his
feet; “de tief! de savage! vould commit von moorder!&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma foi!</i> it
be de miracle I be alive!” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> gathering himself upon his hands
and knees, he muttered, eyeing him askance&mdash;“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je voudrais qu’il s’en
allat!</i>”</p>

<p>The Honourable Edward Stafford rushed also to the lobby, arrayed in
a dressing-gown, having sprung from the hands of a hair-dresser, who
was performing a piece of work upon his ringlets for which he did not
consider the valet qualified; and, to give additional effect to the
figure which he now made in the midst of his servants, he appeared with
the one side of his head in curls, while a comb was left sticking in
the other.</p>

<p>“What! in the name of the Tower of Babel!” cried, or rather squeaked,
Mr Stafford&mdash;“what is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>Alexander, whose natural humour returned at the risible scene before
him, approached smiling; and, extending his hand, said&mdash;“What! don’t
you know me, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Back! back!” exclaimed the honourable and gentle Edward Stafford;
“the effluvia of thy garments is poison to my nostrils! Faugh!&mdash;know
thee&mdash;why thou art a moving tar barrel!” There was some cause for
this last remark; for Alexander had slept with the common seamen
during his passage to London, and his clothes yet bore witness to
the pitchy fragrance of his bed-chamber. But Mr Stafford calling
for an opera-glass, raised it to his eye, and, surveying him for a
few moments, inquired&mdash;“Why, who are you? Your face&mdash;I have seen it
somewhere! Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Have you forgot Cambridge and Alexander Hamilton?” said the other.</p>

<p>“Sandy Hamilton!” exclaimed Stafford, rising an inch, as if in
surprise&mdash;“we always called you Sandy. But, come, let me hear this
lark&mdash;’tis a prime one, I will vow, from your appearance; and yet you
were no lad for life either,” he added, as he coldly held out his
forefinger, and turned to conduct him into an apartment.</p>

<p>Alexander, having related to him his present situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> requested from
him payment of such a portion of his college debt as he might find
convenient.</p>

<p>“A plaguy odd affair, ’pon my honour!” drawled out Stafford; “but I’m
sorry I can’t oblige you just at this moment. Never was a poor dog
so confoundedly dunned! I am obliged to bilk the bailiffs at every
corner. ’Pon my word, Sandy, I have had as many <i>Bills of Middlesex</i>
served upon me, within these six months, as would fill a stage coach!
Nothing could be so provoking!&mdash;My rascal of a tailor, too, got a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quare claussum</i> popped into my hands only this morning! Lost a cool
five hundred last night, also. So, you see I am involved on all sides.
There is no way of redemption for me, that I can see, but taking a walk
across Blackfriars. I do say that it is confoundedly hard that one
can’t oblige one’s friends&mdash;but I hope you see, my dear fellow, that it
is impossible. I am sorry for you, but I can’t help it at present&mdash;you
must see that plain enough. Only, at the same time, your outward man
seems approaching to the third and fourth letters of the alphabet&mdash;and,
if there be anything in my wardrobe that would be of service&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here he paused&mdash;and be it known, gentle reader, that the Honourable
Edward Stafford was one of the most diminutive of men; and as he stood
by the side of Alexander, the crown of his head did not reach his
shoulder. He again proceeded&mdash;“But why, Sandy, you know, when you were
at Cambridge you were the Apollo, nay, the Adonis, of all the heiresses
and rich dowagers within seven leagues. Many of them are in town now,
and would be glad of an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Alexander, reprovingly, “you forget that I am a husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, so you are,” drawled out Mr Stafford;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> “but that need not
cause you to make sermons against your own preferment. I remember now,
it was a low match&mdash;the daughter of one of your father’s clerks! O
Sandy! Sandy!&mdash;I thought you had more spirit.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied Alexander, “my wife is the daughter of an honest man,
whom you contributed to bring low and to ruin;” and, casting upon him
a look of scorn, which caused the small gentleman to make precipitate
retreat behind his chair, he added, with a sneer&mdash;“Farewell, Mr
Stafford, and I wish you joy of your hopeful prospects.” Thus saying,
and without waiting a reply, he left the house.</p>

<p>It was now July, and one hope remained. A gentleman who held a seat in
the House of Commons, and who owed his return to the money advanced by
the late Mr Hamilton, and the activity and zeal of Alexander, professed
to be touched by his misfortunes, and promised to obtain for him a
situation under government, which was then vacant. The day on which he
was to be installed into the office was named; and Alexander, in the
fulness and gladness of his heart, wrote for Isabella to come to London.</p>

<p>It may here be as well to inform the reader that the Honourable Edward
Stafford, of whom we have spoken, was connected with the Borders. As
hinted by Alexander, he had been one of those who had contributed to
the ruin of Isabella’s father. But there was one circumstance which
Alexander knew not, and which was, that, for some years prior to
her marriage, the Honourable Edward Stafford had been her heartless
persecutor, and as a villain had beset her path. The tale of her
husband’s misfortunes having rekindled his hopes, he proceeded to the
north to renew his plots and persecutions.</p>

<p>It was early in August, when a vessel, on board of which there were
many passengers, sailed from the quayside of Newcastle. The morning was
clear, the sky cloudless, and the villages, on either side of the Tyne,
appeared in summer beauty. They had passed Shields, the pilot departed,
and wished them a pleasant passage; several ladies and gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
promenaded the deck, contemplating the scene. Isabella, unconscious
of being observed by all, sat alone on the starboard side of the
companion, her elbow resting by the top of the binnacle lamp, and her
eyes fixed upon the shore.</p>

<p>While she thus sat, an imposing little personage, wearing a superb
Spanish cloak, flung with what may be termed graceful negligence across
his shoulders, and having a highly-flavoured cigar in his teeth,
consequentially ascended the cabin stairs&mdash;looked knowingly towards the
mast-head&mdash;gave two or three springy struts across the after-deck&mdash;cast
an aristocratical glance around the passengers&mdash;stood suddenly
still&mdash;bent pryingly over the companion&mdash;stole round on tiptoe, tapped
Isabella familiarly on the shoulder, and, throwing back his little body
to its extreme altitude, he stretched out his parcel of white fingers,
saying&mdash;“A study for a Rembrandt, by the Graces! I am a fortunate
fellow in meeting you again; but didn’t know, ’pon my honour, until
lately, that my friend, Sandy Hamilton, had the happiness of being
acquainted with you.”</p>

<p>“Mr Stafford,” said Isabella, “the wife of him whom you call your
friend has hitherto been accustomed to plainer language.”</p>

<p>“You are severe, my pretty paragon,” whispered the little man; “but,
now that you are leaving the north country in quest of a husband, do
not disfigure that lovely face with north country formality.”</p>

<p>And, casting aside both formality and delicacy himself, with the air of
a wooer who presumes more upon his own importance than the feelings of
her professed to be beloved, he seated himself by her side, and, with
an affected and seemingly careless playfulness, threw his arm across
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Isabella, rising indignantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> “you have this moment called
my husband your friend&mdash;if you are ignorant of the sacred duties of
a friend, or of the respect due to my sex, and the conduct becoming a
gentleman, let the misfortunes of our house be my protection.”</p>

<p>“Protection!&mdash;creature of beauty!” said he, “I will protect you with my
life! Nay, do not frown; for your anger only makes your loveliness the
more provoking, and calls back the colour which your misfortunes, as
you term them, are trying to banish.”</p>

<p>“Begone, sir,” said Isabella, “practise your fooleries on those who
will listen to them;” and she walked to the opposite side of the
vessel, whither she was immediately followed by her unabashed tormentor.</p>

<p>“Come, sweet one,” resumed he, “do not delight in throwing lightnings
from eyes where moonbeams would blush at the presence of rivals.”</p>

<p>“Your behaviour, sir,” said Isabella, “in any man, but especially
in one bearing the rank of a gentleman, is contemptible, cowardly,
and unmanly. On former occasions I have borne your insults without
drawing upon you the chastisements which you merited; but you now
profess to know me as the wife of your friend, and as such I claim your
respect&mdash;or I shall know how to resent your conduct.”</p>

<p>“An angel in a fury!” exclaimed the Hon. Edward Stafford, with a
theatrical start. “Respect you!&mdash;why, I adore you!&mdash;worship you!&mdash;will
die for you!”</p>

<p>“Pitiable fool!” replied she, turning from him with disdain.</p>

<p>“Only the fool your eyes have made him, lovely cruelty!” rejoined he,
following her, and extending his hand to lay hold of her arm.</p>

<p>“’Vast there, you chap!” cried the skipper&mdash;a round, red-faced,
jolly-looking seaman, who had observed from the helm the conduct of
Mr Stafford;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> “’vast there, I say&mdash;I’ll have no monkey tricks on board
o’ my ship. That young lady is under my especial care; for, d’ye see,
her father was once one o’ my owners, and so was her husband and his
father before him&mdash;and I just tell ye, ceevilly, my canny lad, ye had
better shove your boat off!”</p>

<p>“Fellow!” sneered Mr Stafford, surveying him with a look of contempt,
“do you know to whom you speak?”</p>

<p>“I neither know nor care, young gentleman,” replied the skipper; “but
I’ll let you know that neither you nor any man shall ca’ me fellow, or
use any indecent liberties on board my ship, so ye had better take in a
reef, or keep a look-out for squalls.”</p>

<p>“Heathen&mdash;uncivilized Laplander!” fumed Mr Stafford, stamping his
little foot upon the deck; “do you know, sir, to whom you are opening
your barbarian lips?”</p>

<p>“My wig! I’ll tell ye what it is, young chap,” vociferated the skipper,
“I dinna care though ye were first cousin to the flying Dutchman; ye
shall know I’m maister o’ this vessel.”</p>

<p>“Confound you and your vessel!” retorted the little man, stamping
more passionately than before; “dare you open your frog’s mouth to a
gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Ye poor singet creature!&mdash;ye miserable button top!” rejoined the
skipper, “has an insignificant object like you the assurance to
confound anybody? Are you no feared that I wry your neck about like a
cock-sparrow’s? As sure as death, sir, if ye drop another word o’ your
insolence to me I’ll capsize ye under a bucket.”</p>

<p>“You savage!&mdash;you Greenland bear!” reiterated Mr Stafford, brandishing
his clenched fist in the face of the other;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> “are gentlemen to endure
the boorish insolence of a Hottentot like you? You’ll capsize me
under a bucket, will you? Look you, sir, if you don’t ask my pardon
instantly, before the whole ship’s company, sir, I’ll put a brace of
bullets through your ass’s head! I will, sir! Do you think with your
cowardly carcass to intimidate me? Were you as big as Goliath, I’ll let
you know I’m a gentleman, sir!”</p>

<p>“Here Jack, take the helm,” roared the skipper to one of his crew; “and
now, ye chattering morsel o’ humanity, I’ll let ye see whether you or I
be the best gentleman in this ship, at any bat!”</p>

<p>He sprang forward, Edward Stafford sprang back, and the passengers
sprang between them.</p>

<p>“Hands off, gentlemen, if you please!” said the skipper; “remember I am
master o’ this vessel. I wud wish to be civil to everybody, but it is
not in the power o’ nature to put up wi’ the impudence o’ a creature
like that; and though I’ll no hurt him&mdash;smash me! he shall either haud
his tongue, or he shall never speak more. Did ye hear such names as I
put up wi’?”</p>

<p>“Unhand the ruffian, gentlemen!” cried Mr Stafford, who had retreated
amid-ships, and felt his courage revive under the protection of
half-a-dozen ladies. “Unhand the mountain of moving mud! I’ll teach
such fellows how to interfere with a gentleman! Unhand him, and
I’ll send him below with a piece of cold lead through his fin!” And
heroically taking from his pocket a handsome silver-mounted ivory case,
he placed it with a determined air upon the top of a beef cask, again
exclaiming&mdash;“Don’t hold him, gentlemen&mdash;these will do for him!”</p>

<p>“I tell ye again, sirs,” shouted the skipper, “don’t hold me! Do you
think a thing like that shall threaten to shoot me on board o’ my own
ship?” And he struggled to approach him.</p>

<p>“See to yourselves, gentlemen!” cried Mr Stafford, laying his hand
fiercely upon the pistol-case.</p>

<p>“O sir!&mdash;pray sir!&mdash;dear sir!&mdash;” screamed the ladies, grasping him in
their arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be alarmed,” said the little Honourable; “’pon honour, I
shall only wing him&mdash;I have had some experience in these matters.”</p>

<p>The skipper made a desperate rush forward&mdash;the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> screamed
louder&mdash;Mr Stafford seized the pistol-case furiously, crying&mdash;“Then
die, fellow!&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His exclamation was cut short&mdash;a lady grasped the terrible pistol-case;
it opened in the struggle, and the hateful weapons fell upon the deck,
though not in the shape of pistols, but the honourable gentleman’s
sea-stock of cigars! The gentlemen laughed&mdash;the ladies tittered.</p>

<p>“It has ended in <em>smoke</em>, sir,” said a fair punster.</p>

<p>“You can still <em>fire</em> them!” added another.</p>

<p>And the skipper, laughing like the mirth of a hoarse wave, taking
him firmly by the ear with his finger and thumb, said&mdash;“Gather them
up, sir&mdash;gather up your <em>firearms</em>!” And, as Mr Stafford persisted
in disobeying, another twitch was given to his ear, and another and
another, while he screamed and wept through passion and pain, danced
and twisted to be free, to the amusement of the spectators, who enjoyed
his punishment and humiliation.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Isabella, addressing his tormentor, the frantic cries of Mr
Stafford having brought her from the cabin, where she retired at the
beginning of their altercation; “if a fly sting us, we may drive it
away, without taking pleasure in its tortures; and it is but a cowardly
revenge to torment an insect.”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” said the skipper, withdrawing his hand from the ear of
the other; “I have no wish to hurt the thing; only, after his impudence
to you, as well as to mysel’, he had better have a care what sort o’
colours he hoists for the rest o’ the passage&mdash;that’s all.” The agony
and confusion of Mr Stafford cannot be described. He blushed, swore,
threatened, and wept by turns&mdash;rushed to the cabin, hurried back,
threw his card in the captain’s face&mdash;stamped, stormed, and vowed
vengeance, till he became silent from exhaustion. A few weeks before,
he had left London for the north, partly to avoid the importunities of
his creditors, whose claims had been discharged after his departure
by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> too fond indulgence of a foolish mother, but chiefly to carry
into effect his long-cherished designs against the beautiful wife of
his college companion, whose misfortunes caused him now to look upon
her as an easy and lawful prize; and it was under this conviction that
he watched her departure for London, and took his passage in the same
vessel. Mortified at the ridiculous figure he exhibited, he resolved to
suspend all further attempts until they arrived at London.</p>

<p>But three days were not past, notwithstanding the misfortune of
the pistol-case, until the Honourable Edward Stafford, through the
assistance of self-confidence or impudence, with pretended wit and
foppish extravagance, was again the principal personage in the vessel.
His brandy, his claret, and his cigars, operated marvellously in his
favour with the gentlemen; every one sought his society, and called him
a good fellow. The weather had hitherto been too fine for sea-sickness,
and his agreeable attentions, his vivacity and elegant compliments,
rendered him not less a favourite with the ladies. Isabella alone
despised him; while he, affecting to despise her in return, circulated
foul whispers against her character. Whatever doubts there might be in
the minds of his auditory respecting the veracity of his accusation,
the breath of slander is exhaled from a poison so black, that for a
time its passing shadow will veil the holiness of a saint, and bedim
the radiance of a seraph. Isabella, therefore, was shunned by her own
sex as contagious, and by the other treated with cold indifference.
Occasionally she observed their scrutinizing glances, or coloured at
their half audible whispers, but, in the purity of her own heart, she
suspected not the cause. In the master of the vessel only she still
found a friend, who, although rough as his own element, evinced towards
her the tenderness of a parent.</p>

<p>For some days the wind was adverse, and on the Sabbath morning, being
the fifth from their leaving Newcastle, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> a dead calm. The
skipper was walking backward and forward upon the deck, now glancing
at the clouds, and now at the shore, with the countenance of a man who
considers he has reason neither to be satisfied with himself nor with
others. In the cabin some appeared to read, others yawned, while some
went to the deck and instantly returned. The ladies looked at each
other, whispered, fretted, and exclaimed&mdash;“How tedious!” Isabella sat
silent amidst the unhappy group, “among them, but not of them.”</p>

<p>Mr Stafford, who hitherto had been whistling at his toilette, turned
round and exclaimed&mdash;“Dumb as the foundations of a Quaker’s chapel!
Come,” continued he, placing a couple of bottles of claret upon the
table, “my pantomimic company of tragedians, allow me to administer
the comforts of a calm to the necessities of your poor dumb mouths;”
and, as he poured out the wine, he sang a few lines of an idle song.
The company looked upon each other with a flitting expression of
horror&mdash;none of them had been accustomed to hear the Sabbath so
desecrated, though, as he proceeded, a few of them relaxed into a
smile. But Isabella, rising, said emphatically&mdash;“Sir, the <span class="smcap">FOOL</span>
hath said in his heart, There is no God!” And she pronounced the word,
<em>fool</em>, with a pointed sarcasm, which, although it in some measure
took from the spirit of the original, rendered it more poignant in its
present application.</p>

<p>“Your ladyship!” replied he, sneeringly, and, bowing to her with an air
of mock humility. “Lily of the saints!” he added, “preach on, that the
humblest of thy slaves may treasure up in his heart of hearts the pious
honey of thine own sweet lips!”</p>

<p>He paused, and continuing his attitude of mock humility, commenced to
hum the tune which he before had attempted to sing.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Isabella, glancing upon him with scorn and compassion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> “I
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: missing from scanned copy">pity you.”</ins></p>

<p>“Now for a sermon!” he added, but the words faltered on his tongue, and
he sat down in confusion.</p>

<p>“Sermon or no sermon,” said the skipper, entering from the foot of the
cabin stairs, where he had descended to stop the singing himself, “I’ll
neither allow Sabbath-breaking nor any wickedness that I can prevent,
on board a ship o mine.”</p>

<p>“Come, old prig,” returned Stafford, “I’ve paid for my passage, I
suppose, and I’ll have you to know that I’ll amuse myself as I please.
Don’t think, my good fellow, that because I have listened to a little
sermonizing from a pretty face, that I am to be bored with your
croaking.” And he began to whistle a waltz.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” resumed the skipper, “ye are to be pitied, after a’. I’ll
declare, when I see bits o’ dandy creatures like you glorying in your
wickedness, and doubling your nieves in the face o’ Heaven, it puts
me in mind o’ a peacock spreading its tail to stop a whirlwind, or a
cockle opening its shell to swallow a water-spout!”</p>

<p>At this moment the breeze sprang up, and the mate summoning all hands
to deck, Mr Stafford was left unheeded to reflect on his own folly.
During the night the wind blew very fresh; and the vessel having left
the land and entered Boston Deeps, laboured considerably. From the
ladies’ cabin issued prayers, shrieks, and groans of suffering, and
every one devoutly wished to be once more blest with the tediousness
of a calm; and, as the vessel yawed, rocked, and staggered with the
heavy swell, and the ponderous boom, with its mainsail flapping like
thunder, grating, crashing, clanking, and tearing with sudden jerk,
or with fearful lunge reversing the laws of gravity, and tearing both
mast and vessel into the sea, scream rose upon scream; sickness and
terror met in conflict. Babel seemed above them and thunder below.
The wind bellowed more madly. The plunging of the vessel became more
frequent and more alarming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> There was a running to and fro upon
the deck&mdash;a bawling and a bustle. Darkness hung over them&mdash;thick,
substantial darkness, rendering the very surge invisible. The heavy
clouds seemed embracing the waters, and the crushed winds roared
between the pressure of their meeting. A storm, by almost imperceptible
degrees, had circled round them. Every sail of the vessel was reefed,
and both anchors dropped; but the chain cable snapped like the web
of a gossamer, and she lunged and tugged from her remaining anchor,
dragging it after her, like a fiery horse tearing from the rein of a
schoolboy. The mast bent as a proud man bends in the day of adversity;
the topmast went overboard, striking heavily upon the deck as it fell.
It struck immediately over the bed of the Honourable Edward Stafford.
A loud shriek issued from the curtained railings; they were flung
open, and out sprang Mr Stafford, dragging after him the bed-clothes,
wringing his hands, and crying to Heaven for mercy. The dressed and
the half-dressed now stood around the floor, clinging to each other
and the furniture of the cabin for safety&mdash;each speaking and no one
hearing;&mdash;but a clamour, loud, confused, and fearful, mingled with
the noise of the winds and waves. Isabella alone remained tranquil.
The vessel had dragged her anchor for several miles; they were in the
midst of breakers, and the increased confusion upon deck announced
the horrors of a lee shore, when she suddenly brought to, and half
turning to the weather, a heavy sea broke over her, sweeping from the
deck the boat, casks, and spars, and gushing down the cabin stairs,
encompassed its terror-stricken inmates to the knees. The heart of Mr
Stafford sprang to his throat, and his feet to the table, where he
remained upon his knees, wringing his hands by the side of a flickering
lamp. While he was in this position, the vessel was suddenly driven
upon her side; for, through the darkness of the night, another vessel
had run against her, and she being cracked with age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> the bowsprit of
the other went through planks and timbers, and, before it gave way,
projected rudely several feet into the cabin, forming an unexpected
and unwelcome intruder upon the motley scene of sickness and despair.
Fear had already fastened the gurgling gasp in the throats of many
of the passengers, when a voice from the deck exclaimed&mdash;“Ladies
and gentlemen, look to yourselves!” It was the signal of death. A
general groan followed. There was a rush to the cabin stairs. Calm as
Isabella had hitherto been, she was now changed. It is difficult to
look the grim angel in the face with indifference; but she rushed not
to the stairs with the others. Mr Stafford was driven from the table
by the uncourteous visit of the bowsprit, and now wallowed upon the
floor, buffeting with the brine, imagining himself at the bottom of
the vasty deep. The concussion of the vessels had brought his head
in violent conjunction with the cabin floor, which, with his excited
fears, deprived him of the consciousness of time and place; and being
immersed in water, he continued to gasp, groan, shriek, and flounder
upon the floor, seizing the heels of his fellow-passengers&mdash;who, in
their eagerness for escape, had wedged up the cabin door&mdash;doubting
nothing, as they trode upon his delicate fingers, that he had thrust
them into the mouth of a ravenous fish, which had come to feast upon
his unfortunate body.</p>

<p>“Save me!&mdash;save me!” he cried again and again, as he continued tossing
and rolling in the water.</p>

<p>The vessel again righted, and he was swept to the feet of Isabella,
who, aroused by his cries of terror, raised him to his feet. He
struggled, gasped, trembled. His eyes and mouth opened to their utmost
width&mdash;he appeared to draw the breath of an hour in a moment; and,
gazing round vacantly, he seemed to marvel whether he was in the world
of men, of fish, or of spirits.</p>

<p>“You are living, brave sir!” said Isabella, sarcastically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> smiling
at his excess of terror; “but,” added she, leaving him, “the
Sabbath-breaker and the scoffer are not the most courageous in the hour
of danger.”</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add, that the vessels having got disentangled,
with daybreak the storm abated; and, on the ninth day, after leaving
Newcastle, the vessel drew up off the Hermitage Stairs, Wapping, with
the loss of topmast, anchor, and cables, beef and water casks, spars,
oars, and other minor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et ceteras</i>, together with damaged bulwarks and
hulk; but with the crew and passengers safe.</p>

<p>Isabella had not had an opportunity of writing to her husband, to
acquaint him with the name of the vessel in which she would take her
passage, nor when she would leave Newcastle; and, as they drew up in
the pier, while the friends and relatives of other passengers thronged
around them, to her no hand was extended. She stood as one deserted
upon the threshold of the Nineveh of nations; and the crowds that
passed before her seemed as the ghosts of solitude, giving tongues to
bereavement, and forms to desolation. She felt herself alone in the
midst of millions, solitary as a wearied bird whose wing has drooped in
the wilderness.</p>

<p>She went on shore, where she was immediately accosted by a
hackney-coachman, whom she requested to convey her to a Mr Fulton’s
in Cornhill, to whose care her husband had requested her to forward
the letters she addressed to him. She was informed by the skipper
that Cornhill was not above a mile and a half from the wharf; and, as
the coach drove on, passing the bustling crowds who hurried along the
streets, she forgot for a moment her own feelings in contemplation
of the motley scene. The coach stopped facing the Mint, and the
driver, leaving his box, spoke a few words with another coachman,
who immediately drove rapidly in the direction of Watling Street.
After a few minutes’ delay the coachman again mounted the box. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had never before looked upon a countenance where a grovelling and
villanous soul had written in such broad and unblushing characters
its own worthlessness. It was one of those countenances which it is
hardly possible to pass upon the street without disliking. In it were
pourtrayed meanness, servility, depravity, and deceit&mdash;it was purple
with dissipation, and blotched with iniquity. She shuddered to find
herself, though in the broad day, and in the midst of the metropolis,
under the care of such a man. She began to feel conscious that they
must have proceeded much farther than the distance mentioned by the
skipper, and, with a degree of alarm, she inquired at the driver if he
rightly understood where she wished to be set down.</p>

<p>“Vy, yes,” replied he, “I knows the house well enough; it is Mr
Fulton’s of Cornhill, an’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered; and he added that they would be there within five
minutes, and drove on. Within the time he specified they stopped before
an elegant house in a square, the silence of which was only broken by
the rattling of a few fashionable carriages. The coachman alighted,
and a liveried servant stood ready to receive her. She inquired if the
house to which she had been conducted was Mr Fulton’s of Cornhill, and
the servant answered that it was. She, however, had been within it but
a few minutes, when she became conscious that she was under the roof
and in the power of the Honourable Edward Stafford. Despair gave her
strength; she raised her eyes to Heaven, and in the emphatic words of
Judith, prayed&mdash;“Strengthen my hand!” Grasping a fruit-knife, which
lay near her, in her hand, she made a desperate effort to escape; and,
although the servants aided their master in opposing her, yet, as my
readers have already had a specimen of his courage, and as the heroism
of his domestics was not of that description, which “smiles at the
drawn dagger and defies its point,” they will not be surprised to learn
that through half-a-dozen such assailants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> one weak woman, rendered
desperate, forced her escape.</p>

<p>Having reached Cornhill, she was from thence conducted, by one of Mr
Fulton’s clerks, to Red Lion Square, where her husband then lodged.
Their meeting was one of sorrow and of joy; but I need not describe it.
Alexander perceived that she was agitated, and he entreated to know the
cause. She, fearful of the consequences that might arise from divulging
it, would have concealed it; but it is difficult for an affectionate
wife to conceal from her husband aught that concerns him; and within
half an hour he knew all that had passed during her passage to London
and since she arrived. He would have rushed forth on the instant to
seek revenge, but she clung around his neck, she entreated him not to
leave her, and he consented to defer the punishment of Stafford to a
more favourable moment.</p>

<p>From week to week, Alexander’s expected appointment under government
was delayed; and, although they had parted with almost every article of
any value which they had brought with them, they began to be in want.
Yet Isabella murmured not, but sought to sooth her husband and raise
his drooping spirits. At length, the long wished-for day on which he
was to be installed into office arrived, and ten o’clock was the hour
fixed by his patron for meeting him. Everything around him wore a face
of joy. He now knew that wealth was unnecessary to secure happiness
with one who had taught him that contentment is true riches. He longed
for the appointed hour. There was a tear in Isabella’s eye, but it was
a tear of gratitude and happiness. “Bless thee&mdash;my own!” she said, as
he rose to depart; and in silence he kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>Never until now had she felt the full measure of her anxiety for the
issue of an event to which her husband looked forward with passionate
eagerness. Slowly and tediously the morning passed away; noon came,
and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> hours seemed lengthening; and evening drew on, but it brought
not Alexander. The long summer day died in midnight, but no remembered
footstep stopped at the threshold. The morning dawn stole upon the
voiceless streets, imperceptibly filling them with the slow and silent
light.</p>

<p>“It is another day!” she exclaimed, in agony; “and where is my
Alexander?”</p>

<p>Precisely at the appointed hour, Alexander had arrived at the house of
his patron. The servant who opened the door, muttered that it was too
early&mdash;that his master was not down&mdash;and requested him to remain a few
minutes in an apartment adjoining the lobby. The few <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original text read 'minntes'">minutes</ins> became
an hour. Alexander was mortified and in agony. The clock, measuring
out the moments, seemed to remind him of the insults to which he was
subjected. At length he heard the “great man’s” foot upon the stair,
and rose to meet him. But the patron passed on, and his carriage drew
up to the door. Alexander sprang forward, and, in the excitement of his
feelings, placed his hand upon his shoulder. The bestower of patronage
turned haughtily, and demanded the cause of the interruption. Alexander
returned his glance with equal haughtiness, and demanded to know how he
had dared first to mock and now insult him.</p>

<p>“Begone, fellow!” exclaimed the senator, contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Never!” replied Alexander, “until you have apologized for that word,
and for having dared to mock me.”</p>

<p>The courage of the silent member was rather of an aspen character, and
he became pale and trembled. Struggling for dignity of manner, shaking,
and calling up an air of offended importance, he said he should have
felt pleasure to have served him, in consideration of the kindness of
his family; but added, after considerable faltering and hesitation,
that he was compelled to withdraw his countenance and patronage, owing
to the representations which he had heard of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> habits and character,
and that, in consequence, the situation he intended for him was already
bestowed upon another.</p>

<p>“Representations regarding <span class="smcap">MY</span> habits and character, sir?”
exclaimed Alexander; “tell me who has dared to revile me.”</p>

<p>“My informant is a gentleman of honour and of family, one who knows you
well&mdash;and beyond this I will not be braved to inform you.”</p>

<p>“You shall!” exclaimed Alexander.</p>

<p>“Never!” answered the other bitterly, and called to his servants to
obtain assistance and give him into custody; and as he spoke he slid to
the farther corner of the lobby. Alexander’s eyes glared upon him as a
wounded lion measures its victim. There was an unearthly earnestness
and determination in his manner that might have appalled a stouter
heart. He grasped the trembler firmly by the arm, and in a tone more
impressive than anger, slowly and solemnly inquired&mdash;“What is the name
of my defamer?”</p>

<p>“The Honourable Edward Stafford,” stammered out the other, awed by the
desperate resoluteness of his manner.</p>

<p>“Stafford!” exclaimed Alexander, starting back&mdash;“am I then a second
time stung by a worm?&mdash;poisoned by a reptile?&mdash;Stafford!” he repeated,
and hurried from the house.</p>

<p>He had turned aside into the Park, to conceal his agitation, indulging
in the secret determination to proceed to Leicester Square and seek
vengeance upon his enemy; but his gestures betrayed the agitation
of his spirit, and excited the loud laughter of two horsemen who
rode behind him. He turned fiercely round upon the mockers of his
misery&mdash;one of them was the Honourable Edward Stafford. Alexander
sprang upon him, and dragged him to the ground, as a tiger springeth
upon his prey. In his fury he trampled him beneath his feet, and he lay
bleeding and insensible upon the ground, when his companion, having
procured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> assistance of the police, Alexander was taken into
custody, and, being brought before the magistrates, was committed for
trial.</p>

<p>Wretched and disconsolate, Isabella beheld the sun of another day set,
and yet she heard nothing of her husband. She had hurried from street
to street, wild and restless as a household bird, which, escaped from
its cage, breaks its wings and its heart, as it flutters, without
aim and without rest, through the strange wilderness of liberty.
Wearied with fatigue, and well nigh delirious with wretchedness, she
was ready to inquire of every stranger that she met&mdash;“Have you seen
my Alexander?” And again and again she returned to their silent and
comfortless lodgings; but there the sound of her own sighs murmured
desolation; and, in impatient agony, she exclaimed&mdash;“My husband!&mdash;my
Alexander!&mdash;where shall I find him?”</p>

<p>She had sent messengers in every direction, and to all of whom she had
heard him mention but their name; and, in her agony, her tearful eyes
had wandered over the broad Thames, fearfully and eagerly surveying
its shores, and following its stream for miles, till, faint and weary,
she sank despairing and exhausted on the ground. A letter from her
husband was at length put into her hands, which informed her that he
was then a prisoner in Newgate. She immediately hastened to the gloomy
prison-house, and when she arrived before it, and beheld its ponderous
gates, studded with bolts of iron, and overhung with the emblems of the
felon’s chain and the gibbet, she recoiled back for a few paces, and
her heart failed.</p>

<p>Until the time of admission arrived, she wandered disconsolately in
front of the prison, and, on being admitted, she heard the sound as
of an unruly multitude issuing from the corner of the prison whither
she was conducted. She was shewn into a large and noxious apartment,
where about a hundred individuals, of all ages, the accused and the
condemned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> were assembled together&mdash;some cooking, some practising
the art of the pickpocket, and others holding mock courts of law. Her
heart became motionless with horror as she gazed wildly around the den
of guilt and pollution. On perceiving her, they desisted from their
amusements and boisterous mirth, and gazed upon her in silent wonder.
Their sudden and unusual silence aroused Alexander, who was sitting
alone in a dark corner of the room; and, sorrowfully raising his head,
he perceived every eye turned upon his own beautiful and afflicted
wife. He sprang forward, and, forgetful of all around, she sank upon
his bosom. He led her to a remote corner of the apartment, and pressing
her hand to his breast&mdash;“Ah, my Isabella!” he whispered in agony, “this
is indeed kind! to visit me in such a place, and in the midst of these
miserable beings!”</p>

<p>“Say not kind, dear husband,” she replied&mdash;“what is too much for the
affection of a wife to do? Horrible as this place is, but yesterday to
have known that you lived, and I could have been its inmate for life.”</p>

<p>“Isabella,” added he, “for imprisonment I care but little&mdash;from a
tribunal of my countrymen I have nothing to fear; but there is one
constant and heart-piercing misery which is consuming me. While I am
here a prisoner, who will protect, who will provide for you, my love,
for you?”</p>

<p>A faint smile trembled over her features as she replied&mdash;“<span class="smcap">He</span>
who sheltereth the lamb from the storm! <span class="smcap">He</span> who provideth the
ravens with food!”</p>

<p>“But,” added he, “are not we already almost without money?&mdash;And, until
I am free, until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come, love,” said she tenderly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> “do not afflict yourself with idle
fears. The sparrow chirps not the less joyfully in the farm-yard
because the last sheaf is given to the flail; but day after day
finds the little flutterer happy and contented as when it nestled
in profusion. You bade me come smiling, and you only are sad. Come,
love&mdash;give me one smile&mdash;fear not for me; with my needle I may be
enabled to provide for myself, and to assist you.”</p>

<p>“Isabella!” he exclaimed, starting with agitation, and smiting his hand
upon his brow.</p>

<p>“Nay, love,” she added, “start not at shadows; when real deprivations
are to be averted, yield not to those of pride and imagination.
Adversity is a stern master, but it relaxes its brow before a cheerful
pupil. Come,” she added, “let us rather speak of what I can do for my
prisoner.”</p>

<p>She endeavoured to pronounce the last word playfully; but the attempt
failed, and she turned aside her head to conceal a tear.</p>

<p>“Nay, sweetest,” said he, affectionately drawing her hand from her
face, “do not weep&mdash;I will not be unhappy&mdash;for the sake of my Isabella
I will not.”</p>

<p>But the day of trial came; Alexander was placed before his judges, and
his faithful wife stood near his side. The clerk of the court rose,
and, holding the indictment, said, “Alexander Hamilton, you are charged
with committing an unprovoked and outrageous assault, with intent to
murder, upon the person of the Honourable Edward Stafford, in Hyde
Park. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p>“Not guilty,” said the prisoner, firmly.</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution then rose&mdash;“Gentlemen of the jury,”
said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> “I confess I am at a loss to find words to express the
deadliness of purpose, and the desperate character of the assault with
which the prisoner is charged. A deed more reckless, more atrocious
and criminal in its character, never was attempted. Its aim was
blood!&mdash;murder at noonday, in the Park, and in the midst of hundreds.
After this, where is safety to be found? Were the prisoner to go
unpunished, madmen might be set at large, and assassins crowd our
streets with impunity. The ferocity of a savage of the woods, when
fired by victory and inflamed with the war-whoop, is tame, compared
with the brutal violence which was manifested by the prisoner. With
a disregard of all personal consequences, his object was <em>murder</em>!
I repeat the word&mdash;murder was his object; and he has failed in
accomplishing it only through the prompt assistance of the medical
gentleman to whose care my client was intrusted. I do not say this from
a desire to influence you against the prisoner; but from a regard for
truth, for our common safety, and the public welfare. I shall prove to
you that this is not a solitary case of the prisoner’s outrage; but
that, on the same day on which he attempted the life of the prosecutor,
he was guilty of a scarcely less daring assault upon an honourable
member of the House of Commons&mdash;that on former occasions he has forced
his way into the house of Mr Stafford, and endeavoured to extort money
by violence. In short, the evidence is such as will leave no doubt upon
your mind of the prisoner’s guilt and desperate character, and assures
me of what will be your verdict. What plea he will set up, I know not;
but he who could attempt the life of a fellow-man in broad day, will
not be nice as to the expedients to which he resorts. Should temporary
insanity be urged, I need not tell you that you will not consider
whether it be lawful for a person subject to such fits of lunacy to
be left to go at large amongst mankind; and that, if such a plea be
offered, you will duly examine that it be established.”</p>

<p>During this harangue, not a muscle of Alexander’s face moved; but he
stood with his eyes bent upon the speaker, manifesting throughout the
same calm and proud look of conscious innocence. Isabella exhibited
almost the same calmness as her husband; but at times the glow of
indignation and impatience flushed her cheek, and she threw upon the
accuser a glance of scorn.</p>

<p>I will not enter into the evidence. Several of the witnesses were
gentlemen of rank, who, having been spectators of the assault in the
Park, gave an unprejudiced statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> of what they had seen, and their
testimony tended to prepare the minds of the court to give credence
to the evidence of less respectable witnesses; for they confirmed
the desperate character of the attack and the injury received by the
prosecutor. A herd of others were suborned to aggravate the charges,
and to controvert whatever evidence the prisoner might bring forward.
The case for the prosecution closed, and every hope of acquittal was
destroyed. Still he maintained the same firmness; and, for a few
seconds, not a sound was heard throughout the court. To the ear of
Isabella, the breathless silence was as sudden thunder; hitherto, while
listening to the accumulated perjuries with which her husband’s ruin
was sought, notwithstanding her hopelessness and agony, her eye had not
wandered from him; but she now turned, with a wild and imploring look,
towards the jury, at once to read on their countenances the impression
which the evidence had made, and to conjure them in speechless agony
to believe it not. But she, shuddering, turned away from the appalling
scene, and a groan burst from her bosom. She beheld in their features
the cold, fixed expression of men who knew no feeling but justice; and
she saw their eyes turned to her husband, but in sternness rather than
in compassion.</p>

<p>“Prisoner,” said the judge, “you have heard the charges which have been
preferred against you; if you have any witnesses on your behalf let
them be brought forward; or, if you have aught to say in your defence
why judgment ought not to be pronounced against you, speak now.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Alexander, “I crave your indulgence. Trusting to
innocence, I have employed no counsel, and I hoped to need none. If,
therefore, in the few words which I shall speak, I depart from the
rules and usages of this court, I beg your protection and direction.
Gentlemen of the jury,” he added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> “much of the evidence which has
this day been given before you has not impressed upon you a firmer
conviction of my wickedness than it has filled me with horror at the
baseness and the perjury of which men can be found capable.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” interrupted the prosecutor’s counsel, “such language is not
to be borne.”</p>

<p>“The prisoner has claimed my protection,” said the judge, “and he shall
have it. Proceed,” added he, addressing Alexander, “but remember that
unsubstantiated charges against others will only aggravate the proofs
already given, and militate against you.”</p>

<p>Alexander bowed, and continued&mdash;“Gentlemen, that you believe me the
guilty being that I have been described, I cannot for a moment doubt;
nor do I hope that I shall be able to shake that conviction, and prove
to you between myself and the prosecutor, who is, indeed, the guilty
party. I know well that words spoken by one situated as I now am come
in a questionable form and produce but a slight impression, yet, as
truth is stronger than falsehood, I would hope that what I do say may
not be altogether ineffectual. That I did make an attack upon the
prosecutor in the Park, is <em>true</em>; that my manner was as enraged as has
been described, I admit; and that my language might be of a threatening
character, I do not deny; but that my intentions were criminal, that I
sought his life, is false.”</p>

<p>He then stated the nature of his acquaintance with Stafford&mdash;his having
forced his way into his house to request payment of a part of the debt
which he owed him. But when he spoke of the indignities which he had
offered to his wife, and of the calumnies he had whispered in the ear
of him who was to procure him an appointment under government, his
soul flashed truth from his eyes, every glance told a tale of scorn
and wrongs. Stafford, who was present, quailed as the tide of his
eloquent indignation rolled on; and could the astonished listeners
have turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> their eyes from the speaker to him of whom he spoke,
they would have read guilt and confusion on his pale cheeks. Even the
judge laid down his notes, and gazed upon the prisoner with a look of
wonder. Isabella’s fears passed away as she listened to the torrent of
indignant eloquence which he poured forth; and, while she participated
in the admiration of the crowd, she felt also the affection and the
pride of a wife, and, starting from a seat with which she had for some
time been accommodated, she pressed closer to his side, her bosom
heaving, her cheeks glowing, and her beaming eyes declaring that, where
he then stood as a criminal, she was proud to call him husband.</p>

<p>“Could any man,” he exclaimed, in conclusion, “bear more than I did and
not resent it? Would any of you, gentlemen&mdash;yea, would his lordship,
under the same provocations, have acted otherwise than I did? If the
attack was furious, was it not provoked? Or could human nature endure
more and attempt less? If I am culpable, it is because I have the
feelings of a man&mdash;because I am not more or because I am not less than
man: and, if I am guilty, is my prosecutor innocent?”</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution again rose, and added&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>“Gentlemen of
the jury, I presume it is now unnecessary for me to remind you that
the prisoner having attempted murder on one of his Majesty’s subjects,
it is altogether unnecessary for him to perform it now upon his
Majesty’s English. If rhetorical froth were proof, and sound received
as evidence, the case of the prisoner might be different from what it
is. But it unfortunately happens for his oratory, that froth is not
proof, and that noise is not evidence. I will not insult your good
sense by adverting for a moment to his shallow calumnies and malicious
assertions. You will place them to the spirit of hardened wickedness
that invented them. But, gentlemen, we shall now see what evidence he
has to bring forward in support of his oratory, and in substantiation
of his malicious and frail subterfuges.”</p>

<p>No witnesses being likely to appear in behalf of the prisoner, the
governor of the gaol voluntarily came forward and bore testimony to the
excellence of Alexander’s conduct while under confinement, and also to
the exemplary affection and modesty manifested by his wife.</p>

<p>He left the witness-box, and another pause ensued, when Isabella sprang
forward, stretching out her arms towards the jury, and exclaimed&mdash;“Hear
me! hear me!&mdash;only for a moment&mdash;as you are men&mdash;as you are fathers&mdash;as
you are Christians, hear me! Do not tear my Alexander from me&mdash;he is
innocent! Yes! yes! he is innocent of the guilt attributed towards him
by the wicked man who seeks his life!&mdash;innocent as your babes that may
smile at their mother’s breast! Save, then, my husband, and heaven will
reward you! He is all that is dear to me&mdash;will you tear us asunder? If
ye have hearts within you, you will not. Look on his countenance&mdash;is
there guilt there? Look upon his prosecutor, upon his enemy who sits
before you, and oh! can you find innocence where dissipation has left
its furrows, and hatred its shadows? If ye <em>will</em> do what may seem
to you justice&mdash;remember to love mercy! Draw not upon your heads the
misery or the blood of a human being through the guilt of a false
witness! Save, I implore you, save my husband, for he is innocent!”</p>

<p>The judge summed up the evidence, and more than once he paused and
wiped away a tear that did not disgrace his office. “Go,” he concluded,
addressing the jury&mdash;“the prisoner is in your hands; and if there be a
doubt upon your minds as to whether you should pronounce him guilty,
give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt.”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven!” exclaimed Isabella, “deliver my husband&mdash;make known
his innocence to these men!” She stretched her hand towards him, and
cried aloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> “O my Alexander&mdash;in death&mdash;even in death, I will be
yours! They shall not part us!”</p>

<p>And, as she wept, he bent over the dock and threw his arms upon her
neck, exclaiming&mdash;“Loved one, weep not. The Avenger of the oppressed
will not forsake us.”</p>

<p>The jury were rising to withdraw, every eye was moistened with
Isabella’s distress&mdash;while all felt conscious of her husband’s
doom&mdash;when a humming noise arose amidst the spectators, and, “Let the
jury stop!&mdash;let the jury stop!” cried many voices from the door.</p>

<p>The skipper of the vessel in which Isabella had come to London pressed
into the court; and, being sworn&mdash;</p>

<p>“Weel, sir,” said he, “it isn’t much that the like o’ me has got to
say; only, ye see, Mr Hamilton here, that ye ca’ a prisoner, is an
auld owner’s son o’ mine. I have known him since he was the height o’
my knee, and he was always a guid and a cannie laddie; and I venture
to say, had his father not been ower honest a man, and paid twenty
shillings in the pound to every body, he wouldna hae been in his grave
to-day. As for <em>the thing</em> that is carrying on the prosecution against
Mr Hamilton, I knaw something o’ him tae; and he may think himself weel
off that it wasna a wife o’ mine that he shewed his blackguardism to,
for had I been my auld maister’s son, hang me! after the insults I saw
him offer to this bonny lady here, when they were both passengers on
board o’ my ship, Jemmy Johnson, take me! if I wudna hae twisted his
neck off his shoulders in a moment!”</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution had risen to ridicule the evidence
of the prisoner, when he was interrupted by a negro servant of the
Honourable Edward Stafford, who had been touched by the fiery eloquence
of Alexander and the distress of his wife, and who rose and exclaimed,
while others attempted to keep him down&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>“Me will speak!&mdash;Massa be de
grand villain! Me be black, but you won’t make me one black heart.
De prisoner be innocent! Massa do owe him von hundred pound, for me
carried it to massa, and massa did try to steal de wife ob Massa
Hamilton; which, be bad&mdash;berry bad! Prisoner be de injured man, like de
poor African!”</p>

<p>This involuntary testimony on the part of the negro arrested the
attention of both judge and jury, and they were requesting that he
should be placed in the witness-box, when two gentlemen hurriedly
entered the court, and pressed forward, requesting to be heard. The
one stated himself to be a Mr Fulton, a broker in Cornhill. With him
Alexander’s father had long had extensive dealings. He has already been
mentioned in the course of this narrative. Alexander had requested that
his wife should address her letters to him to his counting-house. But
he was abroad when Alexander reached London, and he only arrived on
the evening before his trial. He knew the services which his friend,
the elder Hamilton, and his son also, had conferred upon the member of
parliament of whom we have spoken, and calling upon him, and hearing
the accusations that were preferred against Alexander by Stafford, he
demanded that they should be probed to the bottom. They did investigate
into them, and they discovered them to be wholly false and without
foundation. And the patron now came forward to express his contrition
for the act of injustice into which he had been betrayed, and to bear
his testimony against the character and malignity of the prosecutor.
A change came over the countenances of the jury. The judge seemed
perplexed, and was rising to sum up the evidence, when they rose as one
man, and exclaimed&mdash;“<em>Not guilty</em>.”</p>

<p>“Not guilty, my lord,” repeated the foreman of the jury; “but it would
give us pleasure to see the accuser stand where the accused has this
day stood.”</p>

<p>The spectators burst into a shout, and the Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> Edward Stafford
endeavoured to escape from the court. All that is necessary to add is,
that Alexander Hamilton became the clerk of Mr Fulton, in a few years
his partner, and eventually his successor, and his latter days were
more prosperous than any that his father had known, while the worth of
his wife and her affection increased with age. One word respecting the
Honourable Edward Stafford, and I have done. In a few years he became
a titled beggar, and twenty years afterwards, when Alexander Hamilton,
with his wife and family came to reside in Northumberland, where they
had been born and brought up, they heard of a poor gentleman at an inn
in the next village, who seemed to be in great distress. They went
to visit him&mdash;it was the Honourable Edward Stafford. He wept as he
recognised them. In the words of holy writ&mdash;they heaped coals of fire
upon his head&mdash;and with his hand in Alexander’s he breathed his last,
and at their own expense they buried him with his fathers. Such are a
few Leaves from the Life of Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<h2>THE SPORTSMAN OF OUTFIELDHAUGH.</h2>


<p>The old property of Eyrymount&mdash;belonging to a sept of the Græmes that
had at a former period emigrated to that locality, not far from the
Borders of Scotland, and possessed, at the time we speak of, by Hugo
Græme, a man somewhat advanced in years&mdash;was (for it has latterly been
broken down into small portions) one of the finest small possessions
of a commoner that could be seen in the fairest part of Scotland.
Compact, and divided into two portions&mdash;one of the richest arable
soil, and another, where the mansion-house stood, of planted ground,
adorned by green trees and flowering shrubs&mdash;it was just that kind of
property which, filling the purse and pleasing the eye, a man of sense
and a lover of nature would choose to occupy and draw the rents of.
The proprietor of this fine retreat&mdash;Hugo, of the fourth generation
of these Græmes&mdash;was the very worst kind of man that could have been
placed upon such an estate; for he held that kind of middle station
between the exclusive great and the not exclusive, which, producing
discontentment with what is in one’s power, and generating an ambition
seldom realized, neutralizes all the advantages of independence, and
changes the gifts of Providence into gilded evils. The property was
too small to enable him to cope with those whom he wished to associate
with, while it was too extensive to admit of its proprietor being
classed with many of the neighbouring lairds. Yet his pride struggled
with the physical impossibilities with which the limited nature of
Eyrymount surrounded him; and his life for many years had been occupied
by a series of efforts to make up, by art and diplomacy, what could not
be wrung from his patrimonial inheritance. His wife, Madam Græme&mdash;as
she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> styled by the neighbours, from her possession of a pride equal
to, if not transcending that of her husband&mdash;was the daughter of a
rich banker, who, after her marriage, lost his wealth, and, of course,
the charm which procured for him the enviable title of father-in-law
to Hugo Græme of Eyrymount, the fourth lineal heir of the southern
sept of the Græmes. The pride which had been generated in the bosom
of the young lady by expectation, was not relinquished with her hope
of succeeding to a fortune that had taken to itself “the wings of
the morning.” Bringing in this way no riches to her husband, she did
not leave behind her the evils which generally attend them and often
survive them; and the hundred thousand pounds she expected to succeed
to, though now in the pockets of other people, and feeding a pride of
a more legitimate kind in the bosoms of the possessors, founded that
kind of claim to honour which a ragged heir of a thousand acres which
have been out of his family for fifty years, thinks he has a right to
assume, from the mere circumstance of his grandfather having been the
laird. The pride of the master and mistress of Eyrymount, strong in the
original stems, was strengthened, but not, like the forest crab-apple,
improved, by the mutual ingrafture of connubial sympathy; and they
strained and pulled together, in their efforts to stretch the income
of Eyrymount into the means of supporting a state to which it was
inadequate.</p>

<p>An only child&mdash;a female, of considerable pretensions to beauty, simple
and humble, and highly interesting in her manners, and called, after
her mother, Dione, a title of which Madam Græme was very proud&mdash;added
considerably to the pride of the haughty couple. They expected “to turn
her to account,” and had already fixed their eyes on an old rich nabob,
called Benjamin Rice, who had taken up his residence at Pansey Lodge,
in the neighbourhood, as a very suitable and easy kind of person, who
would likely have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> objection to enter without much struggle into
the matrimonial noose. They never thought of consulting Dione on the
subject; for, though they did not dispute that she had “some interest”
in the affair, they took for granted that, as one of the family, she
was solicitous for the enhancement of its fortunes, and would at once
sell herself for the good of the Græmes of Eyrymount. The nabob was not
averse, at least in the first instance, to partake of the fine dinners,
served up as a costly kind of bait at Eyrymount House. The dyspepsia,
which, along with his rupees, he had caught in India, made him nice
in the selection of his food and wine; and no cost was spared by the
fortune-hunting Amphytrions, to procure for him whatever might please
his palate. Neither had the nabob any disinclination to feast his eyes
on the fair face of Dione, who received his looks and attentions very
much in the way that children do that emetic Indian shrub, called
ipecacuanha. The tyranny of her proud mother, however, prevented her
from shewing symptoms of displeasure, when she felt herself subjected
to his scrutiny; and, as yet, no hint had been given that he was
selected as the man who was to make her “happy for life.”</p>

<p>Next to the getting off of the fair Dione in a carriage and four, and
repairing his fortunes with the fortune of her husband, Hugo Græme had
long sighed for getting back the merk-land of Outfieldhaugh, formerly
a part of Eyrymount, and very foolishly, as he thought, given off from
the estate, by his grandfather, Murdoch Græme, to a favourite friend,
at a small yearly feu of only a pound sterling. This property was now
a very pretty place; having been, by the first feuar, embellished by
plantations and fanciful shrubs, which, in the course of time, had
grown up and covered the high parts with an umbrageous clothing of
variegated hues, glittering in the setting sun with a splendour which
could too well be seen from the windows of Eyrymount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> The envied place
had been taken from the main estate in the most awkward and provoking
manner possible; for, in place of being, what its name implied, an
outfield, it lay in the very bosom of Eyrymount, and was composed of
the best land of the property, besides enjoying the finest prospect on
any part of the estate. Beyond all, it was for ever in the eye of the
gazer from the casements of the old house; and the original feeling of
regret was embittered by a daily accession of displeasure, as strangers
at Eyrymount pointed out to the laird the beautiful spot, and asked
whether it formed part of the old domain.</p>

<p>The fault committed by Murdoch Græme, had been attempted to be cured
by Hector Græme, the father of Hugo, who did everything in his power
to prevail upon the proprietor of Outfieldhaugh to dispose of it again
to him, whereby the integration of the old estate would be effected,
while another property could easily be procured to the satisfaction of
the seller, who had no family feelings or prejudices to gratify, by
clinging to his possession. These efforts, however, had proved vain;
for the proprietor of Outfieldhaugh was just as fond of his merk-land
as Græme was of his larger possessions; and did not hesitate to get
angry, as he was well entitled to do, when solicited to part with his
property, to gratify a family pride he despised, because, perhaps, he
had no family of his own of which he could be otherwise than ashamed.
The wish which had actuated Hector Græme through life was transmitted
to his son on his deathbed; particular directions having been given
in his will that his heir should be upon the watch, night and day, to
pounce upon Outfieldhaugh, and reincorporate it with the main estate,
and a hint added, that there was no occasion for being over-scrupulous
as to the mode by which that great object should be accomplished. This
hint was only the advice which Hector himself had followed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p>“Honesty has nothing to do with the getting back of what should
never have been given away,” said the dying man to Hugo, who sat by
his bedside after the clergyman had departed. “I have examined all
the rights, charters, infeftments, retours, and what not, and held
them up to the light, to see if I could detect what the lawyers call
‘erasures;’ but, though I never could see daylight through them, your
quicker eyes may be more successful. There’s a clause in them, binding
the heirs of Outfieldhaugh to lend the charters to us as the superiors.
I forced a loan of the title-deeds upon that clause, and had a good
fire in my library, which I looked at often, and then at the charter
again, and then at the fire again; but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” And with these
words on his tongue, old Hector Græme, who was called the honest laird
of Eyrymount, expired.</p>

<p>The recommendation of old Hector was not lost upon Hugo, who
recollected, particularly, the hint about the library fire; but a
slight legal education he had received in his youth taught him that, as
the charters had been registered at Edinburgh, the library fire could
not aid him in getting back Outfieldhaugh. After he became satisfied
of this, but not before, he “disdained,” as he said, “to reacquire the
property in the manner recommended by old Hector, who knew nothing
about the act 1617; besides, how could he get the titles, without an
obligation to redeliver them ’within a reasonable time and under a
suitable penalty?’” He resolved upon another plan; but whether it was
less dishonest than the speedy mode recommended by old Hector, and
affected to be despised by him, may be safely left to the judgment of
the world. This much may be said for Hector’s project&mdash;that he had the
merit of philosophizing; for, though the qualities of phlogiston had
already been pretty well ascertained, the effects of its application to
the rights of another person’s property had not often been examined,
except by the anti-philosophical fifteen who sit in the Parliament
House of Edinburgh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> who foolishly allowed themselves to be led by
musty acts of parliament and old precedents. The mode adopted by Hugo,
again, was purely empirical, and, besides, suggested to him by a change
having taken place in the proprietorship of Outfieldhaugh.</p>

<p>Some time previous to our historical era, the proprietor of the envied
property died, without children, and without any settlement. His
heir-at-law was a poor hind, called Nashon Heatherton&mdash;a name given to
him by his father, who believed that a scripture appellation, taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
aperturam bibliorum</i>, or chance opening of the Bible, would be attended
with luck&mdash;a belief well justified by the result. Nashon had got little
or no education, and, though a remarkably good-looking, stalworth
countryman, was accounted shy, if not simple&mdash;an idea, however, derived
merely from his appearance, which denoted no great mental vigour,
though the truth was, that he had more wit than his neighbours, being
only “shy of using it,” and having a perverse pleasure in leading
people astray, while he enjoyed the unprofitable errors that were
continually made, in imputing to him a facility of being imposed upon.
The intelligence that the hind, Nashon Heatherton, had succeeded to
Outfieldhaugh, produced, apparently, greatly more effect upon the
public, who were not to benefit by it to the extent of a farthing, than
upon the “fortunate youth” himself; who, when the attorney told him of
his luck, replied, with a smile, that “he had nae faith in lawyers, an’
wad be cautious in takin possession o’ an estate, till he was satisfied
he was the true heir.” Nashon had no intention of being very difficult
to be satisfied on the point of right; but some who did not understand
the vein of his humour, said he was an idiot who could not distinguish
good from evil.</p>

<p>When Nashon Heatherton took possession of Outfieldhaugh&mdash;a step he
adopted without the necessity of the application of force, contrary to
the ideas entertained by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> neighbours&mdash;he was waited upon by his
superior, Hugo Græme, who went for the express purpose of taking the
dimensions and properties of the new proprietor, with a view to his
ulterior schemes, which he had been remodelling from the instant he
heard of the devolution of the envied right on an obscure, illiterate,
and simple hind.</p>

<p>“I am come, sir,” said Hugo, as he entered the hall of Outfieldhaugh,
and accosted Nashon, who was sitting in the finely furnished apartment,
occupied in “glowrin frae him&mdash;I am come to wish you joy of a
possession which has come to you without expectation; and, therefore,
must yield you pleasure, greater and of a different kind, than
acquisitions of property generally do, even to heirs.”</p>

<p>“I haena felt it yet,” replied Nashon, looking up to Græme with a
curious, arch expression of face. “The auld hoosekeeper, Esther
Maclean, has been cryin a’ day aboot the beauties o’ the place; but she
says there’s nae conies on’t, sae there can be little amusement either
for me or Birsey, wha sits growlin there because he’s no at his auld
quarters at Conybarns.”</p>

<p>“We have more foxes than conies in these quarters,” replied Græme,
struck with the cause of complaint stated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</i> by the new
proprietor.</p>

<p>“I suppose sae,” replied Nashon, eyeing Græme expressively; “there’s
nae want o’ them in ony quarter; but they’re easily got quit o’; for,
whar there’s nae <em>fules</em>, there’s nae foxes. We had nane o’ them at
Conybarns.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have a grateful recollection of that place,” said Græme.
“Old Langbane, the laird of it, would, I understand, sell it. You
should purchase it.”</p>

<p>“I hae aneugh o’ property,” replied Nashon; “when I hae
Outfieldhaugh&mdash;maybe owre muckle.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand me,” said Græme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> “I mean that you should sell
Outfieldhaugh, and buy Conybarns with the price.”</p>

<p>“That wadna be ill to do,” said Nashon; “for they say the laird of
Eyrymount has a keen ee to the place; but dinna ye think I should just
be doin wi’t? There’s owre muckle wood on’t, but that can be easily
mended wi’ a guid axe; an’ I can get a breed o’ conies frae Conybarns.”</p>

<p>“Useful improvements,” said Græme, staring at Nashon, and unable to
ascertain whether he was an idiot or a wag.</p>

<p>“I hae ither changes i’ my head,” replied Nashon, “if I could be at
the trouble o’ bringin them oot. I like a stir aboot a place. There’s
some fine waterfa’s i’ the dell yonder; but what’s a waterfa withoot
a mill? Folk rin after thae things, an’ seem to like the noise o’ the
dashin waters; but hoo muckle mair noise wad there be if there was a
guid birlin spinnin mill alangside o’ them? Besides, there’s some life
aboot a mill&mdash;the swearin o’ the men spinners, the screighin o’ the
hizzies, their love-makins i’ the green haughs, their penny waddins i’
the ale-houses. It’s thae things that mak a country place lichtsome.
I wonder that Eyrymount hasna mair sense than to keep his place sae
quiet. I’ll shew him an example.”</p>

<p>“That may not suit his taste,” replied Græme, at a loss what to say;
for he had some suspicions that Nashon knew him; and the introduction
of himself was now made a difficult matter.</p>

<p>“It is impossible, sir,” said Nashon: “would it no suit his taste to
mak siller? They say he spends weel; and, while his waters are rinnin
to the sea, withoot ca’in a single mill, he may rin dry&mdash;unless,
indeed, Benjamin Rice marries his bonny dochter, Dione.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking Esther Maclean has been giving you the news of the
place,” said Græme, trying to smile, but unable to get beyond a grin.</p>

<p>“Ou ay, the cratur has been trying to amuse me,” said Nashon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> “for she
couldna bear, she said, to see me sittin i’ the middle o’ this big ha’,
lookin frae me, an’ thinkin o’ the huntin o’ the conies o’ Conybarns;
but when the mills are set agaun, we’ll hae something to keep us out o’
langer. I may, peradventure, think too o’ some tanneries. It’s a pity
to lose sae muckle oak bark; and Jamie Skinner, the leather merchant o’
Peebles, says he could sell as mony skins as I could gie him.”</p>

<p>“But you forget, Mr. Heatherton,” said Græme, beginning to lose temper,
“that you have only a servitude to a limited extent over the Well Burn,
and will not be entitled to destroy the purity of the water.”</p>

<p>“But water doesna rin up the brae, sir,” replied Nashon. “I’m below
Eyrymount, an’ my neebours below me winna object. But, after a’, I
think o’ mony things I never execute.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will think twice about these things,” said Græme. “I merely
called in, as a neighbour, to wish you joy. Good morning!”</p>

<p>“Guid mornin, sir!” replied Nashon, without rising from his chair.
“That’s Eyrymount himsel,” he continued, after Græme had departed, “if
Esther’s account o’ him be correct. Isna that the laird o’ Eyrymount,
Esther?” said he to Esther Maclean, as she entered.</p>

<p>“The very man,” replied Esther. “Was he wantin to buy Outfieldhaugh
frae ye?”</p>

<p>“Ou, ay,” replied Nashon; “but I tauld him I intended to build spinnin
mills an’ tannaries on the Well Burn.”</p>

<p>“An’ do ye intend to spoil yer estate in that way?” said Esther.</p>

<p>“It’s no very likely,” replied Nashon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> “The value o Outfieldhaugh lies
in its woods an’ waterfa’s; an’, though I pretended to like the whin
muirs o’ Conybarns better, it was only to bring the laird oot, an’ see
if ye were richt in what ye tauld me. I think ye’re nearly as wise as
mysel.”</p>

<p>While Nashon and Esther Maclean were thus comparing notes, Hugo Græme
returned to Eyrymount, and had a conference with his lady on the
character of the new proprietor of Outfieldhaugh.</p>

<p>“What kind of a boor have you found this new proprietor of your old
estate?” said the lady, as he entered. “Is he simple enough to sell, or
wild enough to dissipate it by incurring debt?”</p>

<p>“He is either the most arch rogue or the greatest fool I ever met in
my life,” replied Græme. “I intended to introduce myself after the
first salutation; but the idiot began talking about Eyrymount as if
he thought I were some one else, and said such things as entirely
prevented me from making the declaration. His housekeeper is old Esther
Maclean, whom he has retained; and she, who bears us no good feeling,
has told him everything he requires to know to put him on his guard
against us&mdash;that is, I mean, if he has wit enough to take advantage of
it; for I doubt yet if he is not a born idiot. He talked about hunting
conies, and building spinning-mills on the Well Burn, like a madman;
yet, if he knew whom he was talking to, there was a sense in his
madness which I do not much like.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask him if he would sell Outfieldhaugh?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p>“I did,” answered Græme; “and his answer was a question&mdash;‘Dinna ye
think I should just be doing wi’t?’ What could you make of a person who
could return such an answer to a plain question?”</p>

<p>“But you say he talked of hunting,” said the lady. “That is a very good
way, as you well know, of getting into debt.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it depends on the game,” replied Græme&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>“cony-hunting, with
an old hairy terrier he calls Birsey, will not ruin him, even if he
found any conies on Outfieldhaugh, which I defy him to do.”</p>

<p>“But the spirit of Nimrod,” replied the lady, “extends to every kind of
game, whether real statutory game, conies, or pigeons. Give him a smack
of reynard, and the despicable cony will soon be left to its burrow.”</p>

<p>“If he has wit enough to distinguish between a fox and a rabbit,” said
Græme&mdash;“which, however, I doubt. Every effort must, no doubt, be tried.
Outfieldhaugh must be got by force or stealth. It must be Dione’s
dowry, when she is wedded to Benjamin Rice; and when he dies, as he
must soon do, if one can have any faith in his gamboge-coloured skin,
we shall have our patrimonial estate entire; and his large fortune to
dash away with in successful competition with Sir James Featherstone
of Cockairney, Sir George Beckett of Turf Hall, and all our sporting
neighbours, who at present outstrip us in the race of pleasure, and
excel us in the court of fashion. The question is&mdash;How is this to
be accomplished? ‘He that dares well fares well,’ as the saying is;
and I think we cannot do better than try to innoculate this piece of
untenanted spiritless flesh with a little of the blood of Nimrod and
Pollux. Hunting and horse-racing comprehend within themselves all sorts
of expensive dissipation. If he joins our Soho Club, he will require
money. I will lend it, if I should borrow it for that purpose; and I
know the nature of an adjudication.”</p>

<p>“The project sounds well,” said the lady; “but I must see the
cony-hunter myself, for women are better judges of men, than men are
of their neighbours. I will give him a dinner, if you will give him a
present of a hunter. We must blow the soap-bell before it flies and
bursts.”</p>

<p>“If you are to make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle</i> of him, you must indeed prepare plenty
of soap,” said Græme, smiling at the cleverness of a vile pun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> “But,
without a joke, he is a good-looking boor, were he washed. A cake of
soap, with your invitation card, might be of some importance. It is
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpha</i> of the education of a gentleman, and we must begin at the
beginning.”</p>

<p>This conversation was overheard by the gentle Dione, who was, in no
small degree, interested in the affair propounded by her parents. She
now knew, for certain, their intentions in regard to the disposal of
her hand; and, while her judgment disapproved of their scheme, which
was unfair towards the simple-minded (so she termed him) Heatherton,
and cruel to herself, her feelings rebelled against a union with
the gamboge-coloured old Indian, who had already ogled her into a
sympathetic jaundice. The process of her thoughts was extremely
favourable to calling forth a strong interest in favour of Nashon,
whom she had never seen, but whom she figured to herself as a plain,
good-looking man (as indeed he was), whose simplicity was about to
be taken advantage of, for her sake, by his property being unjustly
wrested from him and given to her, as a dowry, on the occasion of her
marriage with a man she hated. Simple as she herself was, she felt
inclined to counteract these ambitious and unjustifiable intentions;
and, if Nashon Heatherton had been known to her, and in any way worthy
of her affections, she would (so she theorised) have thrown herself
into the arms of the new laird of Outfieldhaugh, saved him from ruin,
and herself from an interminable grief.</p>

<p>The intensity of her feelings, called up by what she had overheard,
and inflamed by the workings of her own mind, drove her into the
surrounding woods of Eyrymount, where she might weep unobserved; and
the excited state of her feelings sought relief by the natural means of
speaking out her thoughts. She was overheard by Nashon. They spoke. An
explanation took place, and that sympathy which follows often on mutual
knowledge, led the way to love. He learned from her her own unhappy
position, and the intentions of her father to ruin him, for the purpose
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> securing Outfieldhaugh. Proceeding homewards, he thus monologized:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An’ sae Eyrymount wants to ride me to the devil that he may get
Outfieldhaugh! He maun be ignorant o’ the siller I got as the auld
laird’s executor, besides the estate as his heir. Let him remain in
his ignorance, an’ we’ll see wha will ride langest an’ wha’ll keep
strongest. My neck has as mony liths in’t as Eyrymount’s craig; an’ if
he canna get Oldfieldhaugh except by stretchin mine, I’ll no’ get his
dochter Dione without gien his a thraw. Can onybody blame me? Am I no
fechtin him wi’ his ain weapons? and, besides, are we no strugglin for
the same object&mdash;the junction o’ the twa estates that hae been owre
lang separated?”</p>

<p>Continuing his train of thought farther than we think it necessary
to record it, Nashon arrived at Outfieldhaugh House, at the door of
which he met Esther Maclean, who presented to him a face so full of
expression, that the ideas seemed to be struggling in all parts of
it to get down to her mouth for vent. It was clear that something
pertaining to the Eyrymount family had occurred during the few hours’
absence of her master; for few other subjects could have produced such
a mute loquacity as her moving wrinkles exhibited when Nashon entered.</p>

<p>“Your threat to big spinnin mills on the Well Burn has biggit your
respectability, guid sir,” she exclaimed. “Read that, and then tak a
turn into the stable.”</p>

<p>Esther handed to Nashon, as she spoke, a letter from Madame Græme,
finely perfumed, the sight and smell of which produced a convulsion in
the old simple frame of mind of the quandam hind, which he did not care
about exhibiting even to Esther. The application of his large coarse
fingers to the <em>single drop</em> of scented green wax with which the note
was sealed, produced a mysterious kind of feeling of awe without a
visible cause, which was entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> new to him; and the great array of
Cupids and roses stamped on the margin of the fine hot-pressed paper,
completed the effect of this mute Ariel from the regions of high life.
The note was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Græme, of Eyrymount, present their respects to Mr.
Nashon Heatherton, and request the honour of his company to dinner at
Eyrymount, on Wednesday se’enight, the 15th instant, at five o’clock.”</p>

<p>On the other side of the note were a few lines, in another and a bolder
hand, to this effect.&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Græme, who has had already the honour of conversing with Mr.
Heatherton, presumes upon his character of feudal superior of
Outfieldhaugh, to mark the introduction of a new vassal by some
trifling consideration; and therefore, and as the Soho Club meet for
the purpose of paying their respects to Mr. Reynard to-morrow at the
Shaking Bridge over the Hazel Burn, he requests Mr. Heatherton’s
acceptance of his favourite hunter, Springall, and the pleasure of his
company at the chase.”</p>

<p>“My auld maister wad hae tauld me what was in the letter,” said Esther,
turning up her eyes expressively into the face of Nashon.</p>

<p>“An’ yer new ane winna refuse ye the pleasure,” answered Nashon.
“The braw folk o’ Eyrymount have invited me to dinner on Wednesday
se’enight, and sent me a hunter for the chase, the morn, at the Shakin
Bridge.”</p>

<p>“An’ will ye gang?” said Esther.</p>

<p>“Surely,” replied Nashon&mdash;“ordinary politeness seems to demand it; but
what will I do for a huntin dress?”</p>

<p>“Yer ancestor’s scarlet coat winna disgrace his heir,” replied Esther.
“It’s up i’ the leather kist, i’ the blue parlour yonder; an’ I’ll mak
oot to get a len’ o’ a pair o’ boots frae Squire Hawthorn’s butler,
wha’ll never let on the thing to his maister.”</p>

<p>Nashon smiled at the idea of borrowing a pair of boots;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> but pride had
not yet in him attained that height which enables its votaries to look
down with contempt on the obligation of a loan, and he chose to sport
Squire Hawthorn’s boots and Squire Græme’s horse in the meantime, to
gratify an object which would require still greater sacrifices. Next
day, accordingly, he appeared at the rendezvous, where he in a short
time was accosted by Eyrymount, who was accompanied by the proprietor
of the under part of the neophyte’s habiliments.</p>

<p>“You will find this sport better than cony-hunting, Mr Heatherton,”
said Eyrymount, laughing.</p>

<p>“Ou ay,” replied Nashon; “but I fear it’s mair expensive. I may become
owre fond o’t, an’ the rents of Outfieldhaugh may scarcely haud agen
the expense.”</p>

<p>“You cannot complain yet,” said Eyrymount, looking significantly at
Springall.</p>

<p>“I should think not,” said Squire Hawthorn, looking as significantly at
the boots.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nashon, drawing up his leg a little, but immediately
throwing it down again, with a jerk of the stirrup&mdash;“but I ken my
weakness. I had nae less than nine terriers, ance, at Conybarns&mdash;a
perfect pack; an’ I wadna wonder to see me hae as mony fox-hounds&mdash;ay,
an’ maybe as mony hunters. I fear, Eyrymount, I maun lay a’ that cost
at your door.”</p>

<p>“There’s no sound on earth like the tally-ho!” cried Eyrymount,
delighted with Nashon’s views, which seemed to coincide so well with
his own. “You will be a true son of Nimrod, an’ may carry away the gree
of the hunting-cup of the southern sept of the Græmes.”</p>

<p>“I like baith the drinkin-horn an’ the tootin-horn,” said Nashon; “an’
will empty the ane an’ fill the other as weel’s ony fox-hunter i’ the
kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! I have not been mistaken in you,” cried Græme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“The grey lark flees highest o’ a’ the singin’ tribe,” replied Nashon;
“an’ the bright gooldie the lowest. Ye canna ken a man frae his coat,
ony mair than ye can tell whether a cat is a guid hunter frae the
colour o’ her skin.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Squire Hawthorn; “neither can you know a man from
his boots.”</p>

<p>“If they’re borrowed, ye can say that he’s a cautious, savin chiel wha
wears them,” replied Nashon; “but, if they’re bought an’ no paid,” with
a significant look at Hawthorn, who was known to be deep in debt, “ye
can say he’s an ass. Is the horn no sounded yet? I’m keen to set aff.
My bluid’s getting warm wi’ the thought a’ the throw aff an’ the hark
on. Ho! he! ho! tantivy! tantivy!”</p>

<p>And Nashon cracked his whip as he thus emulated, by a loud bellow, the
spirit of the huntsman.</p>

<p>The chase began, and was continued with great spirit. Reynard displayed
his usual tact; and the hounds, Squire Hawthorn’s pack, were in fine
blood. Nashon’s tally-ho was heard ringing loudest in the woods; his
horse was the finest of the company; and he scoured on like the wind,
heedless of the laugh that was attempted to be raised against him by
Hawthorn, who had told several of his friends, that Springall, which
once belonged to him, knew the touch of the heel of his old boots, and,
if they did not take care, would carry the clown in at the death, and
shame the whole Soho Club. This sportive sally was successful in more
ways than one; for while its humour was well-calculated to produce
cachination, there was a ratiocination in it which was calculated to
produce a lugubrious reaction for, to the surprise and discomfiture of
all the huntsmen, Nashon Heatherton was the individual who was in at the
death&mdash;a feat, doubtless, as much owing to the speed of Springall as
to the dauntlessness of the rider, who, however, displayed great power
of horsemanship and surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> presence of mind, on grounds of great
difficulty and danger.</p>

<p>In the evening the club enjoyed the hospitality of the proprietor of
Nashon’s underfittings, and, although the borrower had, during the
day, suffered the gibes of the young fox-hunter, he did not think that
either these or the relation in which that part of his dress stood to
the lender, disqualified him from eating his meat or drinking his wine.
That he would be dubbed the butt of the company, he knew before he
went; but he felt himself under the obligations of a peculiar humour,
that ruled him with a power paramount to other considerations; and, in
the present instance, that humour was itself subservient to objects of
ambition of high import&mdash;motives that led him to overlook the temporary
buzz of an innocuous raillery on the part of men who were fast going to
a destruction which he was taking active means to avoid. He, therefore,
put on the appearance of enjoying the fox-hunters’ peculiar mode of
draining the cup of pleasure to the dregs, laughed, sang, drank, and
even essayed, on one or two occasions, a sturdy oath. His strength,
robust health, and unsubdued constitution, enabled him to cope with
the strongest of these Tricongii in their own element, wine; and when
the <em>great cup</em> was brought in&mdash;which was generally when all parties
were in that intermediate state between sense and forgetfulness which
demanded in charity a total finisher, to send them to entire oblivion
and rest&mdash;he was as sober as a judge. A quarter of an hour after the
emptying of that fearful goblet, the fox-hunters around him, who had
been high in their humour of drawing “rises” out of him, according
to the slang of aquatic sportsmen, or “baiting the badger,” in their
more appropriate dialect, fell at his feet, singing as they descended,
“with a hey ho chevy!” and all groaning in rough chorus. He alone sat
immoveable, laughing at the sleeping pack who had been, during the
night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> following him with their deep mouths, and boying forth their
humour. Where were they now? Their game had become their whipper-in,
though they were unconscious of his whip. He took Græme’s hand as he
slept, and shook it as that of his father-in-law to be, and wished him
joy of Outfieldhaugh. He then mounted Springall, and sought his home
and his bed.</p>

<p>On the day appointed, Nashon, dressed and scented in great style,
dined at Eyrymount. There were present several fox-hunters, Benjamin
Rice, and others of the neighbours&mdash;none of whom came up to Nashon
in brilliancy or scent. They seemed all delighted and amused with
the grotesque figure, excepting Dione, who stared at him in sorrow
and disappointment; for she could not conceive how so sudden a
transformation from simplicity to gaudy glitter and bad taste, could
have taken place on one who appeared to be gifted with prudence and
good sense. She feared the hunter had turned his brain, and that
her father and mother were in a fair way of seeing their scheme
accomplished. Her pride was, moreover, hurt, when she saw the man
whom she had begun to love, made a laughing-stock to a whole company,
including the hated Benjamin Rice, who was himself exquisitely fitted
for filling the high office so unaccountably occupied by the plain
and cautious Nashon Heatherton. Nor was she better pleased with his
conversation, which, while his old Scotch was retained by necessity,
was directed towards subjects which she thought he despised&mdash;the
interminable hunt, the turf, the dog-kennel, and the wassail chamber.</p>

<p>“I am told, Mr. Heatherton,” said Benjamin Rice, “that you were in at
the death at the last hunt, and that you stood the great cup better
than any one of the company.”</p>

<p>“Ou ay,” replied Nashon&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>“I hae turned a great sportsman, thanks to
Eyrymount! an’ no bad hand at the bottle. I’m at present on terms wi’
Gib Cowper, the horse-jockey, for twa famous hunters, as guid, I
think, as Springall. They’re baith by Bellerophon, real bluids; but he
asks twa hundred guineas for them, an’ that I think is ower muckle; I
offered him a hunder and ninety.”</p>

<p>“Where are they to be seen?” inquired Græme.</p>

<p>“I dinna ken,” replied Nashon. “He brought them to Outfieldhaugh; but
wadna leave them in my stable till we bargained. He said he would ca’
again. I hae been offered Lord Luxmore’s pack, too, at four hunder
guineas, fifty head, that is about four guineas a dog&mdash;owre muekle,
dinna ye think, Eyrymount?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Eyrymount&mdash;“I’ll run halves with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll consider o’t,” said Nashon. “His lordship said he wad see me
again. We’ll better no seem owre anxious&mdash;we may mak a better bargain,
especially as they say he needs money.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” whispered Hawthorn to Eyrymount, “that the borrower
of my old boots has any serious intention of keeping a pack?”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” replied Eyrymount.</p>

<p>“Poor simpleton!” said Dione to herself, with a sigh, as she looked
on the ruddy cheeks and open countenance of her grotesquely dressed
lover&mdash;“has he fallen into the very snare I unwittingly pointed out to
him?”</p>

<p>“You are the most spirited laird that Outfieldhaugh ever saw, Mr
Heatherton,” said Madame Græme. “It is a great pleasure to have a
neighbour like you alongside of us.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m as weel pleased wi’ the high-spirited Eyrymount,” said
Nashon&mdash;“we’ll dash away nicely thegither.”</p>

<p>“Saw you ever such a fool, Miss Græme?” whispered Benjamin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> “He will
soon dash through Outfieldhaugh. If he had ploughed the salt seas, and
endured the blisters of a tropical sun for his money, as I have done,
he would know better how to guide it.”</p>

<p>Dione intuitively turned her face from the orange-coloured Indian
towards the rose-coloured youth, and sighed.</p>

<p>“Are you to be present at the steeple-chase on the 19th?” said
Eyrymount to Nashon.</p>

<p>“Surely,” replied he, readily, “I canna resist a steeple-chase. I
ken nae sport like that mixture o’ rinnin, louping, man&oelig;uvring,
jockeyin, tumblin, an’ brak-neck feats o’ horsemanship. It’s right
glorious. If life had naething better to offer us, as a reward, for
a’ we are doomed to suffer between the cradle and the grave, a guid
steeple-chase wad be aneugh to mak us a’ wish to live our lives owre
again. What are the rules?&mdash;will Springall be admitted?”</p>

<p>“No; he is beyond the age,” replied Græme, “but Hawthorn will sell ye
Copperbottom.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I’ll ca’ the morn an’ see Copper,” said Nashon. “If I buy, I’ll
ride him mysel&mdash;I’ll trust nae jockey. If I win I’ll gie the gentlemen
o’ the Soho Club a chance for the prize again by anither steeple-chase,
the day after the next county races, whereat, by-the-by, I wad like to
hae a sweat for the gowd cup, as a guid way o’ bringin a person into
notice, especially whar ane is his ain jockey, as I wad be, wearin a
green silk jacket as livery. Hoo gran’ it wad be to hear the leddies
cryin, ‘Success to the green!’&mdash;bettin their gowd pins on his comin up
in guid time to the winnin post, and then shakin hands wi’ the victor,
wi’ a thousand gratulations on his success!”</p>

<p>“Do my ears deceive me,” said Dione to herself, “as my eyes seemed
to do when I saw the piebald character of his dress? How powerful is
pride, when it is stimulated in the hidden recesses of the mind of the
peasant, by the magic wand of fortune! Alas! alas! my choice is now
between a foolish beggar and a heartless nabob.”</p>

<p>The effect produced by Nashon on the whole company assembled at
Eyrymount was extraordinary. The master and mistress were delighted
with him, and devoted him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> their imaginations, to a speedy
immolation on the altar of the god of folly; the members of the Soho
Club already marked him out as a good pigeon, whose tail-feathers would
enable them to fly yet a little longer in the high regions of fashion;
Dione sighed for a lost lover and ruined simpleton; and Benjamin Rice
counted, in his imagination, his guineas, and congratulated himself on
a gout that prevented him from engaging in sports that might tend to
dissipate them, along with the remnant of a ruined constitution, which
sack, and sago pudding, and panado, could scarcely support.</p>

<p>Nashon bought Copperbottom, ran him, carried the prize, and sold him
next day for ten pounds of profit; on which great occasion he informed
his housekeeper, Esther Maclean, that he intended to entertain the
whole Soho Club at Outfieldhaugh&mdash;a communication that produced a
mixed feeling of terror and wonder on the part of the old housekeeper,
which she had no words adequately to express. She wished him to be
genteel, and like the other gentlemen of the neighbourhood; but she had
heard hints that he was getting fast into the vortex of a sportsman’s
dissipation; and the intelligence that he was to entertain the
“Soho”&mdash;equal, in her estimation, to dining the Cham of Tartary and his
staff&mdash;confirmed the report, and filled her with sorrow and regret. All
her efforts to dissuade her master from his purpose were unavailing:
cards were issued to forty gentlemen; the question put by Esther, where
he was to find the necessary service of table apparatus, the wine,
the cooks, and the waiters, required to be answered; and he was at no
loss for an answer on a subject he had deeply considered. Mounting
Springall, he hastened away to a town at some considerable distance,
and procured an estimate from an innkeeper of the expense of his
projected entertainment. The innkeeper undertook to supply everything,
with livery servants, unknown to the company, and keep his engagement
a profound secret, for so much a-head. The entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> went off in
great style; Nashon presided, with all the manners of a thorough-bred
blood sportsman&mdash;drank, sang, and talked of races and steeple-chases,
with all the slang and spirit of the craft. The wine, the plate, the
service, the servants in livery, and all the appurtenances of a great
establishment, apparently belonging to the merry master of the revels,
were of the best kind, and produced universal admiration. The spirit
and bounty of Nashon were extolled to the utmost, and Squire Hawthorn
admitted, in a whisper to Græme, that the loan of the boots had been
amply repaid. Nashon again drank them all out. The extent of the
potations made no change on the expense, and a folly that was never to
be repeated might be carried with impunity to the confines of madness.</p>

<p>Next morning, after encountering the lugubrious face of Esther Maclean,
who saw in the hired servants and the broken dishes and glasses all
the worst symptoms of approaching ruin, Nashon went out to enjoy the
refreshing breezes that swept along the Well Burn; and, at her beloved
spot, the Monks’ Well, he found Dione Græme sitting, wrapped in
meditation.</p>

<p>“Do I see,” said Dione, as he approached her, “the same individual I
met on this spot on a former occasion, when I thought his unpolished
prudence and good sense would have enabled him to profit by a
disclosure I made without intention.”</p>

<p>“The very same&mdash;Nashon Heatherton,” replied he, “wi’ nae change in him,
except it be that he is, if possible, still mair prudent and far wiser
than he was on that eventfu day.”</p>

<p>“I know you are a riddle, sir,” said Dione&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>“a charade I cannot solve.
Do not the neighbours say, what I have partially witnessed, that you
are inebriated with the spirit of the fox-hunter, and fast riding to
ruin, at the nod and by the example of my father, who, however, is
making his folly subservient to his purpose of ruining you?”</p>

<p>“A’ true, my bonny Dione,” replied Nashon. “Naebody can be blamed for
sayin what I wish him to think. They say, and you suppose, that I am
ridin to the deevil; but will ye believe me when I tell you that I am
only ridin to <em>you</em>? If you’ll tak me as I stand, and marry me in spite
o’ your faither an’ mither, I’ll gie up my mad pranks, and sit quietly
down, as a douce, sensible man, whase greatest ambition and highest
pleasure would be to minister to the comfort and happiness o’ Dione
Græme.”</p>

<p>“My father and mother will never consent to that,” replied Dione. “It
was only this morning that my mother urged me to receive more kindly,
or rather less unkindly, the addresses of Benjamin Rice; but how can it
be that your behaving as a fool can ever come in place of the consent
of my parents, or procure me for your wife, even if I were favourably
affected towards you?”</p>

<p>“If you will tell me that you love me and will become my wife, provided
I get your faither and mither’s consent to our union,” replied Nashon,
“I will tell you the wisdom o’ my folly, an’ explain my riddle&mdash;that,
in place o’ ridin to the deevil, I am ridin to Dione.”</p>

<p>“I must believe the evidence of my senses,” replied Dione. “I have
already given you reason to suppose that I was well affected towards
you; but, if Benjamin Rice has disgusted me, Nashon Heatherton has
terrified me; and I must first see an amendment of your conduct before
I pledge myself to what may be my ruin.”</p>

<p>“Time tries whinstanes, Dione,” replied Nashon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> “an’ my folly is no
quite sae hardened an’ perverse. If ye gang sae muckle by the evidence
o’ yer senses, I hae nae objection to mak them the test o’ my conduct,
when a’ its pairts are seen thegither, an’ my motives for actin as I
now do can be properly understood. Will ye be kind to me, Dione, till I
prove myself the same prudent Nashon Heatherton you first thought me?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly,” replied Dione; “for it is my wish to respect you
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Love you,” said Nashon, making out her sentences. “Dione Græme, if ye
wad only repeat, wi’ thae bonny lips the words I hae now uttered, I
wad soon change the wish into the thing wished for; an’, what is mair,
I wad mak your love the handmaiden o’ your respect, whilk, being an
act o’ the judgment, whase laws are eternal, is mair necessary to the
happiness o’ a marriage than the love o’ the fickle thing they ca’ the
heart, whilk beats fast and slow wi’ the changes o’ wind and weather.”</p>

<p>“Would that my respect were already equal to my&mdash;my&mdash;feeling for you!”
said Dione, blushing.</p>

<p>“The mair appropriate word ye hae now blinked,” said Nashon, “wad hae
been mair pleasant to me; but I maun be content wi’ your thoughts
till I shew mysel mair worthy o’ their bein revealed. The morn’s the
race-day, an’ my steeple-chase prize is to be run for the day after.
Ye may smile as ye like, but the laugh may yet be on the other side.
Ye see how grave I can be when I speak o’ serious things. I understand
your faither has bought a fine new tandem for the occasion. We gae
forward merrily&mdash;dashin awa in fine style. Dinna we, Dione?”</p>

<p>“And where it is to end I know not,” replied she. “My father, I
understand, is merely an extravagant man, who will soon see the end
of his fortune; for I have heard he has been already applying to Mr
Langbane, the rich laird of Conybarns, for a loan of money; but, as
for you, there is a mystery about your extravagance which I cannot
penetrate&mdash;though this much I can easily understand, that he who trusts
himself upon a stormy sea in an open boat, may miscalculate the power
of his own resources in saving him from a watery grave.”</p>

<p>Nashon laughed at the fears of Dione, and, before they parted, assumed
the boldness of sealing the protestations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> his affection, and the
sincerity of his views of ultimate prudence and amendment, by a kiss,
which, though it produced a blush extending from bandeau to tucker,
was, in the end, forgiven with such a sweetness of expression and so
modest a demeanour, that a stoic could not have resisted the impulse
which stimulated the thief to a repetition of the petty larceny.</p>

<p>Nashon’s subsequent proceedings were of the same character as those
already detailed. He attended the races in a borrowed tandem, without
hinting anything concerning the proprietorship of what was presumed
to be his own. His generosity in being the contributor of the prize
of the next steeple-chase was lauded by all those who got a chance
for winning it. Dinners followed at Eyrymount and other places; and
Nashon, following in the wake of Græme, though sometimes leading the
way, appeared to be fast hurrying to the gulf which awaits the victims
of passions whose gratification holds no proportion to the means of
supporting a dissolute life. A year passed on, during which a great
deal of money was spent by Græme, and not a little by Nashon, whose
resources from the funds he got as executor of the proprietor of
Outfieldhaugh were, however, more than sufficient for a much greater
expenditure. In the midst of this dissipation he was repeatedly
attempted to be reclaimed by those who wished him well, and, among
others, his old master, Langbane, had many interviews with him, with a
view of producing some salutary sense of the imprudence of his conduct.</p>

<p>“I hae warned you,” said the old miser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> “an’ my warnins are nae
beetles’ sangs i’ the auld wa’s o’ spaein wives. But the truth o’ our
proverbs works out in spite o’ a’ the warnins o’ Solomon; an I think
we hae ane that says, ‘Set a beggar on horseback an’ he’ll ride to the
deevil.’ I hae seen that verified often i’ my day; and anither o’ the
same kind&mdash;‘Reek comes aye down again, however high it flees’&mdash;is just
as pithy and pertinent to your case. I never mak an apology for gi’en
a man a guid advice; because, if he taks the poker and drives me out
o’ his house, he just verifies another guid auld sayin&mdash;‘He that comes
atween a fule and his ruin, is like him wha interferes atween a man an’
his wife&mdash;he’s sure o’ the reddin straik.’”</p>

<p>“But ye needna be afraid o’ my poker, guid friend,” replied Nashon,
laughing. “I tak a’ ye hae said in guid part, though I fear ye wadna
come sae weel aff at Eyrymount.”</p>

<p>“I believe if I wad lend him the three thousand pounds he wants me to
advance to him,” said Langbane, with a smile, “I might say onything I
liked to him.”</p>

<p>“An’ will ye lend him the money?” inquired Nashon, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I wad rather borrow yours, were it for nae ither object than to keep
it for ye,” replied Langbane.</p>

<p>“A joke has sometimes mair wisdom in’t than the pulpit oration o’ a
greetin minister,” replied Nashon. “I hae nae great confidence i’ my
power o’ keepin thegither the five thousand pounds I hae yet o’ my
executry; an’, if Eyrymount wad tak the loan frae me, I wad tak a
mortgage owre Eyrymount as my security; but I hae guid reason to think
he winna borrow frae his ain vassal. What wad ye think o’ my giein you
the siller, an’ lettin you lend it him in your name, you giein me an
assignation to the debt.”</p>

<p>“As your friend, Nashon, an’ wishin to keep thegither siller whase
wings are fast fledgin, I hae nae objection to your plan,” replied
Langbane. “I hae only ae remark to mak&mdash;Wha is to draw the interest?
for, if I assign the debt to ye, I canna tak the interest, an’ then it
will come out that ye are the creditor.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>“Muckle will come and gae afore my interest is due an’ payable,”
replied Nashon. “I hae every faith in ye. Here is a check on my banker
for three thousand pounds. Eyrymount, ye ken, pays the expense o’ the
lawyer’s papers.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re as well up to thae things as I am,” replied Langbane. “There’s
only ae thing ye dinna seem to ken.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” inquired Nashon.</p>

<p>“There’s a sma commission paid generally to negociators o’ lent
siller,” said the miser. “I’ll only charge ye a half per cent.”</p>

<p>“Weel, ye’ll get it,” said Nashon, “after ye work for’t. There’s nae
commission paid aforehand.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, too,” replied Langbane. “Ye’ll be a proud man wi’ a bond
ower Eyrymount.”</p>

<p>And Langbane left Nashon, with the view of going direct to Eyrymount,
to tell him that he was now willing to lend him the money he required.
The transaction was very soon finished. Langbane got a mortgage over
the property of Eyrymount, and assigned it over to Nashon, who locked
it past in his coffers, along with the title-deeds of his property and
the documents of his remaining cash.</p>

<p>After Eyrymount got this large sum, he increased still farther his
expenditure; while Nashon, having, to some extent, gained his object,
shewed indications of a wish to draw up. Eyrymount noticed this, and
appeared displeased, asking Nashon his reason for not joining him in
the prosecution of his schemes of pleasure. Nashon replied, that his
money was done; an answer which the other apparently expected, and with
which he seemed delighted.</p>

<p>“I have an overplus of ready cash just now,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> “What is the use
of money but to purchase with it the pleasures which this life holds
out in such profusion to those who are willing to buy? Take a couple of
thousands from me, and give me your note of hand for it; a mere piece
of form, you are aware, as I never would put it to execution, relying,
as I do implicitly, on your honour for repayment.”</p>

<p>“What interest wad ye be expectin for’t,” said Nashon.</p>

<p>“Oh, a bagatelle. Say five per cent,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Very weel,” said Nashon, who knew that Eyrymount was paying himself
five per cent, for the same money to Langbane. “I carena though I
lighten ye o’ the twa thousand; but I see nae source o’ repayin’t, save
frae the flesh an’ banes o’ Outfieldhaugh.”</p>

<p>“Things will have gone far, and many changes been effected in us and
our friendships, ere that issue could take place,” replied the other,
who went to bring the money.</p>

<p>The transaction was instantly closed; the bill was given at a day’s
date, and seized by Eyrymount, as would have been the titles to
Outfieldhaugh, if destined to the library fire, their hereditary enemy.
The same course of life was pursued by him, and Nashon still kept up,
for a time, the appearance of going through, with all due rapidity, the
two thousand pounds he had thus borrowed from his friend. The thousand
pounds that had been left in Eyrymount’s hands, of the sum he had
borrowed from Langbane, was not sufficient to keep him going for any
length of time, and application was, therefore, made to the same source
for two thousand more. Nashon supplied the cash, which was, in fact,
just the two thousand pounds he had got from Eyrymount; and Langbane’s
mortgage over the Eyrymount estate was assigned to him in the same way
as the former.</p>

<p>Having waited until he thought a great part of this second loan was
spent, Nashon, who had had, in the meantime, several meetings with
Dione, at the Monks’ Well, was informed by her, that her father and
mother were now begun to press the marriage between her and Benjamin
Rice so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> urgently that she must either consent, or submit to be treated
as a rebel to their authority, and an alien from their affections and
interests.</p>

<p>“You shall never marry Benjamin Rice,” said Nashon.</p>

<p>“And whom shall I marry then?” said the unhappy girl, who had made her
communication to him in tears&mdash;“a ruined spendthrift, who has borrowed
two thousand from my father, and thereby placed himself and his
property in the power of one who, as I told you, had originally in his
view the seizure of an old part of his estate? Where is all your wisdom
new? Alas! how foolish I have been to put any faith in the professions
of one who is incapable of avoiding a danger pointed out to his open
eyes! To marry Benjamin Rice is misery, if not death&mdash;to marry you is
wretchedness and shame, besides rebellion against the commands of my
parents.”</p>

<p>“Calm yersel, Dione,” said Nashon. “I shall go instantly and ask your
father’s consent to our marriage.”</p>

<p>“If an objection existed formerly to your procuring that consent,”
replied Dione, still weeping, “think ye that is removed by your being
now in poverty, and my father’s debtor?”</p>

<p>“We’ll lat alane thae subtle questions, my Dione,” said Nashon, “an try
our mettle. Your father is my friend. Do we no ride thegither, drink
thegither, and laugh thegither? Why should he refuse me his dochter,
if he gives me his confidence? He never rides, drinks, or laughs wi’
Benjamin Rice. I’ll awa to him, an’ try him. A faint heart never wan
sae fair a lady as Dione Græme.”</p>

<p>Nashon accordingly opened the subject to Eyrymount.</p>

<p>“I hae been thinkin o’ takin a wife,” he began, “to see an’ reclaim me,
an’ keep me frae ruin, and Outfieldhaugh frae the hammer.”</p>

<p>“Whom have you in contemplation?” said Eyrymount, fearfully
apprehensive that he was after a rich heiress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> whose fortune would
relieve him and his property from difficulties.</p>

<p>“I hae been thinking o’ twa or three,” replied Nashon. “Conybarns’
dochter, ye ken, will be a rich cratur, though she’s neither a lily o’
the valley nor a rose o’ Sharon.”</p>

<p>“She has the king’s evil,” rejoined Eyrymount, whose objection to this
match was apparent.</p>

<p>“I thank ye for the intelligence,” replied Nashon. “What say ye to yer
ain Dione, provided I could get her consent?”</p>

<p>“My Dione!” cried Eyrymount, in surprise and pride. “Allow me to tell
ye, Mr Nashon Heatherton, that I do not intend to marry my daughter to
my vassal and my debtor. I am surprised at the confidence that enabled
you to propose so ridiculous a project, though I am glad the secret
has come out. It has been for this that you have been dashing forth so
brilliantly; expecting, no doubt, that, by covering the coarse metal of
your original uneducated condition by the tinsel of fashion, you could
produce an impression upon the heart of my daughter. Thus you repay me
for my kindness in taking you out, introducing you to society, and even
filling your pocket with my money, which, by the by, I will now thank
you to repay.”</p>

<p>“I canna pay you,” replied Nashon; “the money is gane&mdash;at least I hae
nane o’t. Ye maun just wait till I save it oot o’ the rents o’ my
property.”</p>

<p>“I will do no such thing,” said Eyrymount, who thought it was now time
to quarrel; “I must have either a mortgage, or an adjudication, which
is just a legal mortgage. Take your choice.”</p>

<p>“I winna meddle wi’t,” replied Nashon; “a wilfu man maun hae his way.
I think ye should just gie me Dione, an’ that wad settle a’; an’,
besides, it wad bring the twa properties thegither.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p>“A man that cannot refrain from impertinence, should not trust himself
in other people’s houses,” cried the incensed Eyrymount. “I request
your instant departure.”</p>

<p>“You’ll maybe ca’ on me some day sune,” said Nashon, quietly, as he
took his hat; “I will be happy to see you at Outfieldhaugh.”</p>

<p>“You will soon see my deputy, at any rate,” said Eyrymount.</p>

<p>“I am much, obliged to ye,” said Nashon, and retired, with a very low
bow.</p>

<p>Eyrymount, who thought his proceedings ripe, instructed his agent to
raise an action of adjudication againt Nashon, whereby Outfieldhaugh
might be forcibly mortgaged to him, in security of his two thousand
pounds. The agent proceeded with all speed to comply with the commands
of his client; and, on a subsequent day, a messenger-at-arms called
at Outfieldhaugh, accompanied by his witnesses, for the purpose of
serving, as it is termed, or, in plainer language, of giving a copy of
the summons to the debtor.</p>

<p>“This is what the lawyers ca’ an adjudication?” said Nashon.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the messenger, gruffly.</p>

<p>“Can ae messenger serve twa maisters?” said Nashon.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“Weel,” said Nashon, “will ye tak a step owre to Eyrymount, an’ deliver
to the laird o’ that property this requisition?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” replied the messenger, taking the paper and reading
it. “I see it is a requisition to pay you £5000, contained in two
bonds, by Eyrymount, to Murdoch Langbane, and assigned by him to you.
It should properly be intimated by a notary, and one of my concurrents
has that qualification, though now greatly reduced.”</p>

<p>“See that it’s legally dune,” said Nashon. “My agent, Gilbert
Shortpage, drew it up, an’ I warrant it correct.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done instantly,” said the messenger, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> filled up
the notary’s name in the paper, and departed to execute his new and
unexpected commission.</p>

<p>At the time the messenger rapped at the gate of Eyrymount, Græme and
his lady were occupied in talking about the prospect they now had of
seizing upon Outfieldhaugh.</p>

<p>“About this time the ambitious Nashon will be receiving my summons of
adjudication,” said Græme.</p>

<p>“A much more suitable gift, from his superior, than Dione Græme,” said
Madam.</p>

<p>“What is this, sir?” said Græme to the messenger, who had just opened
the door of the apartment.</p>

<p>“A <em>requisition</em>, your honour,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“From whom?” said Græme “Nashon Heatherton,” replied the messenger.</p>

<p>“A <em>requisition</em> for delay, I fancy,” said Græme. “Ha ha! ha! He is too
late. The law must take its course Go tell him I cannot comply with it.”</p>

<p>“Would not your honour better read it?” said the messenger.</p>

<p>“Oh, the usual cant, I presume,” said Græme, opening the paper and
glancing over it. “What is this?” he added, letting go the paper, and
falling back on his chair.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” cried Madam, taking up the document, and flying
for a smelling-bottle at the same time.</p>

<p>“It is, Madam,” said the messenger, while she applied the salts to
her husband’s nose, “a requisition for payment of £5000, due to Mr
Heatherton, as assignee of Mr Langbane.”</p>

<p>“Heaven have mercy on us!” cried she, while she continued her efforts
to restore her husband.</p>

<p>The messenger and his men departed, and left Eyrymount and his wife to
the full anguish of their critical situation.</p>

<p>The news of this proceeding got wind, and reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> ears of Benjamin
Rice, who thought it prudent to suspend his visits to Eyrymount. Græme
had now the prospect of losing not only Outfieldhaugh, but his own
patrimonial estate. What could he do but give Dione to Nashon? This
he did. The couple were married; the two properties were afterwards
conjoined; and the sportsman of Outfieldhaugh distanced all his
competitors.</p>

<p>It was on the close of a sultry day in August, about the end of the
French war, that a carriage was slowly wending its way down one of the
principal streets of the town of Berwick. The dust with which it was
covered, and the jaded appearance of the horses, seemed to betoken
that it came from a distance. The postilion, a pursy little man, whose
rosy face bore the indubitable marks of a worshipper at the shrine of
Bacchus, drew up at the first inn which presented itself to view. Out
of the carriage stepped a young man who was plainly dressed in the garb
of a sailor. He had nothing particular about his dress to distinguish
him from the common run of seamen; but his upright figure, and that
indescribable something which is peculiar to a “certain class,” and
which serves to distinguish them from those in humbler situations in
life, at first sight shewed that he belonged to the former. He appeared
to be about twenty-six years of age, while his weather-beaten face, and
a slight scar on his left cheek, shewed that he had borne both “the
battle and the breeze.” He was accompanied by a squat muscular-looking
fellow, who seemed to act in the capacity of servant; although his
sea jargon and hard horny hands shewed him to be more accustomed to
the duty of a sailor than that of a lacquey. After seeing that their
baggage was properly taken care of, they retired together to a private
room.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill,” said he who seemed the superior to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> companion, “how
do you feel after your ride? For my part, I would sooner sail round the
world in a gale of wind, and the ship pitching bows under all the time,
than be again jammed up and jostled in that infernal cage.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” rejoined his companion, “I am as sore as if I had been
soundly thrashed with a handspike; but, howd-soever, that doesn’t
matter&mdash;we must look out for squalls on land as well as on sea, till we
are fairly housed either under ground or in Davy Jones.”</p>

<p>“Take my spy-glass,” said the young officer, “walk down to the shore,
and see if our little hooker is appearing in sight yet.”</p>

<p>“As I take it,” replied Bill, “she can’t be far <em>astarn</em> of us, for she
has had a spanking breeze all day.”</p>

<p>So saying, snatching up his hat, he was preparing to quit the room,
when the officer bawled out&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Vast there, my lad&mdash;I’ll accompany you.” And they both descended
together.</p>

<p>Turning down the arch which leads to the pier, they strolled along till
they overtook four or five men who were lounging at that part where
the pier turns outward at an obtuse angle. Below them lay a longboat,
apparently intended for piloting the ships into the harbour. One of
them was a man about sixty years of age, whose small head and piercing
eye, slouched under a broad-brimmed hat, were strangely contrasted with
the bluff and muscular appearance of his body. His face was covered
with a thick shaggy beard, which seemed not to have been in the hands
of the barber for a month at least. The rest of the men had nothing
remarkable in their appearance; but all of them seemed to be at least
twenty years younger than the old fellow just mentioned.</p>

<p>“Well, my lads,” said the officer, “any ships in sight?”</p>

<p>“Never a one,” replied the old fellow, in a gruff voice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> “we may stand
here all the day blowing our fingers, and whistling to Molly Jackson,
long enough before she send us that windfall.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that windfall may happen sooner than you expect,” replied the
officer. “I expect a vessel soon; she cannot be far distant.”</p>

<p>“Which direction does she come?” eagerly asked the old man. But no
sooner were the words out of his mouth than a square-rigged vessel was
observed doubling St Abb’s, which had before concealed her from their
view. In a minute the blue-jack flew up to her foretopmast head.</p>

<p>“There comes the little <i>Hawk</i>,” cried Bill, rubbing his hands for joy;
“there comes the <i>Hawk</i>, as tight a little craft as ever fought her
guns on one deck.”</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of the brig seemed to act like an electric shock
upon the men. In an instant, hands were seen disappearing from the
flaps of their dirty canvass trousers; and each scrambling down the
pier as best he could, seized hold of their respective oars, and, in a
moment, the longboat was under way, the men pulling as if it had been
for life or death.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the officer; “take me on board with you.”</p>

<p>“Give way, my hearties,” roared out the old man, without attending to
him. “Give way&mdash;there is Hoby Elliot will be at our heels directly.”</p>

<p>“I am commander of that vessel,” cried the officer, running along the
pier to keep up with the boat; but the men were too eager to get at the
vessel to attend to him.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill,” said he, turning to his companion, “see it is no go with
these fellows; so you will just step up to the inn, get our luggage
down, and here is some money to discharge our reckoning.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” said Bill, and moved off.</p>

<p>The brig, by this time, had neared the harbour considerably with the
wind, from the north-north-west, blowing right upon her quarter. The
young officer could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> a feeling of pride and satisfaction as he
fondly gazed upon his little vessel scudding before the breeze, while
her taut masts and long, slight yards, literally covered with canvass,
seemed to bend beneath their load. There is a sympathy which the sailor
feels for his ship, which it is difficult to describe. It is not that
love which a parent feels for his child&mdash;nor yet the love of a child to
its parent; it is not that which a brother feels for his sister. No; it
is something stronger than this: it is the affection which an ardent
lover feels for his mistress&mdash;it is a love <em>riveted</em> by the strongest
links of attachment; in it he has weathered many a tough gale; in it
are contained his jovial shipmates, bound together by mutual hardships
and perils.</p>

<p>The prospect which at this moment presented itself to the officer’s
view was beautiful in the extreme. To the south, beyond the long, flat
sands of Holy Island, were seen the old castle and abbey of Lindisfern,
hallowed by so many sacred associations; beyond them, were seen rising,
in the distance, the castles of Bamburgh and Dunstanburg; to the west,
were the fields yellow with corn ready for the sickle; to the north,
was the bold promontory of St Abb’s, the finest headland in Europe,
jutting into the sea; to the east, was the German Ocean, stretching
away till the view was bounded by the clouds in the distant horizon,
which seemed level with the sea; and, what to the officer was dearer
than all these, there was his little vessel, the pride of his heart,
skimming, like a thing of life, over the blue waters.</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther with our present story, it may not be amiss,
first, to give the reader some insight into the history of the hero of
our tale.</p>

<p>Harry Fenwick was the son of a small landed proprietor in the
south-west of England, who, having unfortunately embarked his whole
fortune in a mercantile speculation, was, by a sudden loss, reduced
to poverty. The distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> occasioned by this misfortune was increased
by the sudden death of his wife, which so preyed upon his spirits
that he soon after died of a broken heart, leaving poor Harry and
his little sister Susan unprotected in the world. But Providence,
who watches over the orphan and the destitute, soon raised them up a
protector in the person of a maternal uncle, who, having been abroad
for a number of years, had amassed a handsome fortune, but arrived in
England too late to close the eyes of his sister. Having no children,
he determined to adopt his nephew and niece, who, from that day,
became as his own. Harry was fourteen years old on the death of his
parents; and his uncle, Benjamin Davis, determined to bring him up to
his own profession&mdash;that of a sailor. He was accordingly entered as a
midshipman on board the <i>Ranger</i>, a fifty-gun ship, where his conduct
was such, that he rose from one degree to another, till, at length,
in an engagement with a ship of superior metal, he so distinguished
himself, that, in reward for his bravery, he was promoted to the
command of the brig <i>Hawk</i>, mounting eight twelves and two short
carronades, with a crew of eighty hands, as smart fellows as ever
sailed on salt water. At the time when our story begins, Harry had
left his ship at Leith, to visit an old friend of his uncle’s, at
whose house he was a frequent visiter. Certain it is, that however
much Harry loved the yarns and company of the old tar, yet there was
another no less powerful attraction, in the person of his gentle and
lovely daughter Maria. Maria Everet was not what most people would call
a beauty; but the grace and symmetry of her slight figure, her sweet,
pensive manners, and the melodiousness of her voice, threw around her
a charm which captivated much more effectually than those whose beauty
dazzles at first sight.</p>

<p>Often would Maria listen, in silent wonder and admiration, to the
conversations between her father and Harry, of hairbreadth escapes,
of storms and battles; and, stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> a timid glance at the young and
hardy sailor, she would sigh, and, like Desdemona, would desire him
to repeat again what he had been relating. Harry, on the other hand,
felt interested in the lovely girl. At first he esteemed her for her
father’s sake, but a better acquaintance made him love her for her own;
and it was with secret joy and inward gratification that the old father
observed the growing attachment between Harry and his daughter. Often
would Harry, when cruising on the coast, think of the peaceful home
of the old sailor, where dwelt she whom he loved above all the world;
and, however far absent, his thoughts, like the needle in his compass,
always reverted to the north. Great, then, was his disappointment,
when, on arriving at Everet’s house, he found that Maria had gone to
England to visit his uncle Ben and sister Susan. Without stopping
longer than to take a night’s rest, he set out for Berwick, where his
ship was to wait till his arrival; and, as he was bound for Plymouth,
after an eighteen months’ cruise, he determined to call on his uncle,
who dwelt on the sea coast. But to return to our story.</p>

<p>By the time the vessel had reached the mouth of the harbour, our old
friend, Bill Curtis, was hurrying along the pier, blowing like a
porpoise, and bawling out to the porter who accompanied him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come, bear a hand, my lad&mdash;I see they are just manning the six-oared
gig!”</p>

<p>On the approach of the gig, Harry leaped down to the landing-place, and
stepped on board. In a moment, the caps of the sailors were doffed in
salutation to their commander; and a smile of pleasure lighted up their
weather-beaten countenances as he addressed them in a kindly manner.</p>

<p>Harry was received on the quarter by his first and second lieutenants;
when the sailors, no longer restrained by the presence of their
commander, and bursting with impatience, asked all at once&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Bill, what’s brought the captain and you so soon back?&mdash;has the
bird flown?”</p>

<p>“Avast a bit,” cried Bill&mdash;“I must first fill up a hole in my stomach,
big enough to hold a hogshead.” So, bursting past, he descended the
companion-ladder, and straightway betook himself to the galley, where
the cook, an old tar who had got his larboard fin carried away by a
cannon ball, was serving, out of a monstrous ladle, a mess of beef
and greens to the old pilot and his boat’s crew, who were already
devouring with their eyes the promised feast&mdash;“Shiver my tafferel, if I
don’t think I could swallow a shark, bones and all, for sheer hunger!”
roared Bill. So saying, he slapped his knife into the beef, and ate as
heartily as if he had not tasted meat for a week.</p>

<p>At this instant, the boatswain’s whistle was heard piping up all hands.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” said the cook.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bill, “they are going to get the ship under way, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“The ship under way!” said the old pilot, rising from a dark corner
where he was sitting. “Is the captain not going to enter the harbour?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” replied Bill; “he is in too great a hurry to see his
sweetheart for that.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” asked the old cook.</p>

<p>“On the coast of Norfolk,” said Bill, “where we are to stop on our
passage. But I must not stand speechifying here while the rest are
busy.”</p>

<p>So saying, he sprung on deck, followed by the old pilot.</p>

<p>When Bill and his companion came upon deck, they found Harry there,
giving orders. The old pilot went up to him, and doffing his hat, said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, I hope you are not going to get the ship under way to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look, sir,” exclaimed the pilot, turning to the northeast, “do you not
see how the sky is lowering over yonder? and do you not feel what a
roll of the sea there is?&mdash;a sure sign of a coming storm, if there has
not been a gale before. Take an old man’s advice for once, and one who
has weathered many a tough gale&mdash;keep not to sea to-night, but enter
the harbour, where you will be safe from every wind that blows.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my old boy,” said Harry; “but a seaman must not be
frightened with every capful of wind that may blow.” So saying, he
moved off to give directions.</p>

<p>By this time the ship was again under way; but, although Harry had
disregarded the advice of the old pilot about entering the harbour, yet
he determined to make the ship snug for what might happen. So, seizing
a speaking-trumpet, he bawled out to some men aloft&mdash;</p>

<p>“Send down the royals and topgallantmasts there.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” shouted half a dozen voices from the clouds; and in a
minute down they came.</p>

<p>Harry, coming up to Archer, the second lieutenant, asked him what he
thought of the weather.</p>

<p>“I believe we are going to get a stiff north-easter,” replied Archer;
“and, by the <i>Lord Harry</i>, there it comes!” said he, pointing to the
east.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Harry, “get the topsails double-reefed, new lash
the guns, and send the carpenter and his mate to secure the boats and
batten down the hatchways. What course do you steer?” asked Harry at
the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>“South-east and by south,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Then keep her head two more points to the east; we must stand without
the Fern Islands, as the wind seems inclined to eastern upon us.”</p>

<p>At this instant, a heavy squall struck the ship, and almost laid her on
her beam-ends. “Luff, my lad&mdash;luff!” roared out Harry to the man at the
wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing the ship much pressed, a midshipman with six men, were sent to
take in the staysails, by which the ship was eased considerably. The
wind, by this time, had risen to a perfect hurricane; the rain fell in
torrents, and the sea-birds were screaming and fluttering about the
rigging, as if seeking for shelter from the wind; the sea, likewise,
had risen prodigiously, and the ship, groaning and weltering at every
plunge, seemed to be cracking at every timber, whilst the creaking of
the guns and the rattling of the blocks greatly increased the uproar
and confusion.</p>

<p>“Surely some hag is dead to-night, it blows so desperately,” said
Clark, coming aft to where Harry was standing; “but, as the ship makes
good weather on this reach, as she is nearly bow on to the sea, it may
be as well to keep her on this tack during the night.”</p>

<p>“O sirs,” said the carpenter, coming up with a face as long as his arm,
“the ship is sinking, and we shall all go to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” said Harry.</p>

<p>“The ship has sprung a leak in the powder-magazine, and the water is
pouring in like a sluice.”</p>

<p>“Hang your long phiz!” said an old grim fellow of a quartermaster,
standing by the main-chains; “why don’t you go and stop it, then?”</p>

<p>“Do you, Clark,” said Harry, “go down and see what is the matter; and
do you, carpenter, get your crew and man the weather pump.”</p>

<p>“There is a leak, indeed,” said Clark, returning; “but nothing to make
a work about.”</p>

<p>“An ugly sea that!” said the old quartermaster;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> “that greenhorn at the
helm has wet me into the skin. You rascal, why don’t you ease the ship
into the sea? If you carry on in that manner, you will soon send us all
to another place of worship.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend, sir,” said he, addressing himself to Harry, “to stand
long on this tack?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Harry; “the ship will labour less on this tack than on
the other; and besides, it is best to get as much sea-room as possible.”</p>

<p>“Had we not better run into the Fairway?” said the quartermaster; “we
are sure of getting shelter under the Big Fern; and I know the coast
well, for I was brought up in these parts.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” observed Harry.</p>

<p>“But a lee-shore is a dangerous place in a stormy night,” added Clark.</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear the lee-shore&mdash;I’ll pilot you in safety; besides, the
lights will direct us.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Harry; “as the wind does not at all seem inclined to
take off, we had better do as you say; and do you, Clark, take some men
and clew up the foresail. Keep her away, my lad,” shouted he to the
man at the wheel. “So, so&mdash;steady. Ready there with the boom-foresail
halyards.”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then boom away, my lads; get the trysail down too, and we’ll run under
double-reefed topsails alone.”</p>

<p>The ship was much eased by this diminution of canvass, and ran much
steadier than might have been expected, only occasionally shipping a
little sea over the weather bow.</p>

<p>“A bit of a gale,” muttered the quartermaster to himself, as he
descended to the midshipman’s mess. “Humph,” said he, observing
the middies seated over a bowl of punch, “you seem to be enjoying
yourselves upon the strength of it.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and would have you to do the same,” exclaimed a little mid,
pushing him a glass of grog;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> “come douse your sou’-wester and join us.”</p>

<p>Little invitation was needed on the part of the quartermaster, who
was one of those characters so emphatically termed, by seamen, “<em>wet
lads</em>,” and who, perhaps, very philosophically reason, that, as
they are exposed to so much fluid of a cold nature without, so a
proportionable degree of fluid of a hot nature within, is necessary to
preserve their equilibrium.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this frailty, there was not a braver nor a kinder heart
in the British navy than that of the old quartermaster. The middies he
called his children; and they, in turn, were accustomed to call him
Daddy, although some of the tricks which they played him savoured of
anything but the respect which children owe to their parents. Having
fallen asleep in the midst of a song, with his pipe in the one hand,
and his glass in the other, this was too good an opportunity for a lark
to be slipped. As his head had fallen back upon his seat, the middies
slyly tied a cracker to his pigtail, and were preparing to ignite it,
when the quartermaster suddenly awoke, and perceiving the trick they
were about to play him, he seized hold of a rope’s-end and soon made
the middies seek shelter from his fury under the table, where, being
unable to get at them, he sung out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Blow me, but you small craft have got into too shoal water for me to
follow you now; but if I get my big guns to bear upon you, I will blow
you out of the water.”</p>

<p>A sailor at this moment entering to tell the quartermaster that he was
required on deck, put an end to the joke, and relieved the midshipmen
from their confinement.</p>

<p>When the quartermaster came on deck, the Fern lights were right a-head;
and, by his directions, the vessel was soon moored under the lee of the
island, in safety from the tempest. Here, after stopping two days, they
again set sail, and had already got off the coast of Norfolk, when, in
the grey of the morning, a man at the mast-head called out&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>“On deck there, ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad?” cried Archer, whose watch it was on deck.</p>

<p>“A large ship with French colours, on the weather bow.”</p>

<p>“Call up the captain and first lieutenant,” said Archer to a midshipman.</p>

<p>“Mast-head again, ahoy!&mdash;what more do you make of her?”</p>

<p>“She looms large, and seems coming down upon us right before the wind.”</p>

<p>Harry and Clark now came upon deck, followed by the old quartermaster,
who, rubbing his eyes, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why what’s the matter now?”</p>

<p>Archer pointed out the vessel, which was still at a great distance, but
evidently nearing them.</p>

<p>“All hands upon deck there!” shouted Harry; “boatswain, pipe up all
hands; and do you, Clark, go up aloft and see what you can make of her.”</p>

<p>“She is a large vessel,” exclaimed Clark, looking through his
spy-glass, “with French colours and ship rig. There, I see her
side&mdash;all black, and white ports; there is one, two, three&mdash;I cannot
count them, they are so thick.”</p>

<p>“Ay, let her come,” cried Harry&mdash;“I warrant her she gets as good as she
brings. Up with the British ensign, my lads, and let the Frenchman see
what we are.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll take good care that it shall not come down in a hurry, with
your honour’s leave,” exclaimed the old quartermaster. So saying,
he mounted the rigging, and nailed the ensign to the mast. “Now, Mr
Frenchman, when that comes down, we’ll strike, but not till then.”</p>

<p>All hands were now on deck, and straining their eyes with looking at
the strange sail.</p>

<p>“Get the ship clear for action,” roared out Harry; “run out the guns
there; pull down the studding-sails. Port!” to the man at the helm.
“So.”</p>

<p>The deck of the brig at this moment presented a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> interesting
sight&mdash;all hands as busy as possible making arrangements for the
engagement. Powder-boxes, sponges, and buckets were strewed along the
deck&mdash;while some were loading the guns, others securing the boats along
the booms, and all in high glee at the thoughts of having a peppering
match at the Frenchman. The brig was soon cleared, with the guns loaded
and double-shotted on both sides, and every man at his post stripped to
his shirt.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no scene more awfully solemn than that which
is presented by a ship going into action. The utmost stillness
everywhere prevails, only occasionally broken by the commands of the
officers, delivered in a suppressed tone, or the whispers of the
sailors delivering to each other little commissions to their wives or
relations, if any of them should fall in battle. ’Tis then that the
sailor’s heart beats high with hope and expectation, mingled with that
undefined emotion of anxiety and dread which the approach of danger
always excites. But let the action once begin, and let him hear the
guns thundering over his head ’tis then that the sailor forgets his
hopes and his fears in his ardour for the conflict. But to return. The
breeze had now freshened; and the Frenchman, scudding before it under a
press of sail, was now almost within gunshot.</p>

<p>“Hang your impudence, you French lubber!” mumbled the old quartermaster
to himself, as he paced up and down the deck with a quick unsteady
pace&mdash;“do you think to run our little vessel under water? But, big as
you are, Mr Monsieur, if the little <i>Hawk</i> does not make you sheer off
as if you had run foul of a lee-shore, my name is not Jack Scroggins.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman seemed inclined to confirm the opinion of the old tar;
for on he came, without altering his course, till, on coming within
hail of the brig, he bawled out&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>
<p>“Pull down your colours and bring to, or else I’ll sink you.”</p>

<p>“Keep your ship away, then,” shouted Harry, “that I may bring her
alongside.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman accordingly did so; but passed so near as almost to carry
away the brig’s toppinglift.</p>

<p>“Now, luff my lad, and fire away, my hearties!” shouted Harry, whilst
the brig shot up to the wind, and a broadside, accompanied with three
hearty cheers, told the success of the skilful man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was now left far behind, when she and the brig stayed
almost at the same instant&mdash;the Frenchman to get at the brig, and
the brig to get her other broadside to bear upon the Frenchman. The
brig was worked to perfection, and came round in fine style. Not so,
however, with the Frenchman; for the sudden broadside of the brig had
put him in such confusion that, when staying his ship, he had forgot to
loose the lee yard-arm of the foresail, by which the vessel hung in the
wind, and finally missed stays. Up once more came the little <i>Hawk</i>,
and saluted him with another broadside, which increased the confusion
of the Frenchman; but, being now on the same tack with the brig, he
soon came up with her, when bringing his whole broadside to bear upon
the <i>Hawk</i>, he poured in such a tremendous volley as to threaten entire
dissolution to the frame of the little vessel.</p>

<p>The guns of the contending vessels had now roused the inhabitants of
the seacoast, and, by this time, the shore was lined with spectators,
who were watching the engagement with intense anxiety. Amongst these,
was no less a personage than Harry’s uncle, Benjamin Davis, with whom
Maria was at that time staying. The old tar, as was his constant
practice, was taking his morning walk along the beach, with his
spy-glass in his hand, and he had witnessed the engagement from the
beginning; and there he was, giving orders, as if he had been on board
the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The brig was, at this moment, passing close under the stern of the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Now, give it home, my lads,” shouted old Ben on the shore; and, as if
in obedience to his command, the brig opened her guns, one after the
other, upon the Frenchman, as she passed, which raked him fore and aft,
and did much execution.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, however, was not long behind; for, keeping his ship
away, he soon came up to the brig; when, opening upon her another
broadside, he would inevitably have sent the little vessel to the
bottom, had not the steersman, by a dexterous movement of the helm,
avoided part of the shock. The shot took effect principally upon the
stern of the brig, tore away the quarter-boards, killed the man at the
helm and three other men standing near.</p>

<p>As soon as the smoke cleared away, the people on the shore were
dismayed to find the little brig sheering off right before the wind,
but still keeping up a running-fire with her stern chasers, at the
Frenchman, who was pursuing her under a press of canvass.</p>

<p>“Curse upon you, for a cowardly rascal, who ever you are, to run away
from a Frenchman!” shouted out old Ben on the shore, whilst the sweat
trickled down in large drops from his forehead. But both he and the
Frenchman were mistaken, in thinking that the brig was endeavouring to
get off; for this was only a feint on the part of Harry, who, finding
that the enemy was so much superior in his weight of metal, saw that
his only chance was in close quarters, when he trusted the bravery of
his tars would prove victorious over the number of the French. Calling,
therefore, all his men on the quarter-deck, he told them that their
only chance of victory lay in close quarters.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, my brave fellows,” he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> “to follow your commander
to the Frenchman’s deck? They are three to one of us; but you know
what the intrepidity of a handful of British seamen can achieve.”</p>

<p>Three cheers followed these words, which were heard by the people on
the shore; and, ignorant of the cause, they anxiously awaited the
result.</p>

<p>“Get the boarding pikes ready there!” shouted Harry; “and every man arm
himself with a cutlass and brace of pistols; and when the Frenchman
comes up, lash her to us, and then to it, yard-arm and yard-arm.”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir,” shouted the men&mdash;“all ready.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman was now again up to the brig, which she already
considered as her prize, when suddenly the <i>Hawk</i> tacked right athwart
her bows, and in a moment was lashed alongside.</p>

<p>“Ay, that is something like,” cried Ben, rubbing his hands for
joy&mdash;“oh, that I was on board of you, to lend you a helping hand!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah, my hearties! and old England for ever!” shouted Harry,
springing on the Frenchman’s deck, followed by thirty of his crew.</p>

<p>“Old England for ever!” shouted his men, rushing after him, like so
many hungry tigers.</p>

<p>The scene which followed was terrific, each party fighting like
furies, and disputing inch for inch&mdash;the deck swimming with blood. Two
fellows set upon Harry at once. One of these, the lieutenant of the
Frenchman, he quickly dispatched with a shot from his pistol; but the
other, a strong thick-set seaman, with a black bushy beard, was just
firing his musket at his head, when a tremendous thwack from a cutlass
behind, severed the stock in pieces, and the next moment the weapon was
sheathed in the Frenchman’s breast. Harry, on turning round to observe
his deliverer, recognised in him our old friend, Bill Curtis, who,
covered with blood and powder, and wounded as he was, was again in the
thickest of the fray, dealing death at every blow. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> time
for congratulation, however, for the enemy was pressing them on every
side; for, although Harry had been nobly supported by Clark and Archer,
with thirty more men, yet the enemy had, by their numbers, hemmed them
in on every side, and would soon have cut them all to pieces, had not
an unexpected attack from behind suddenly changed the fortunes of the
day. This was no other than the old quartermaster, who had been left
in charge of the brig, with the remainder of the crew, with strict
injunctions not to leave her, happen what might. He had, accordingly,
for some time, impatiently looked on the struggle, when, no longer
bearing to remain inactive, he sung out that the ship might go to the
devil, but he would be hanged if he would stand still any longer and
see his shipmates cut to pieces by lubberly Frenchmen. So saying, he
jumped upon the Frenchman’s deck, followed by the rest of the crew, who
were all as eager as himself; and so sudden and furious was the attack,
that the Frenchmen, quite dispirited by this unexpected assault, were
glad to seek shelter from their fury, some in the rigging, others
down the hold, while those who remained were fain to cry for quarter,
which was readily given them. The men in the rigging had fled to
the tops for shelter, but, seeing their comrades obtain quarter,
they also surrendered themselves at discretion. The next minute the
British ensign was waving proudly in the breeze at the topmast of the
Frenchman, and three long and hearty cheers, which were responded to by
the people on the shore, told the success of the engagement.</p>

<p>The loss on both sides was great, though that of the French greatly
exceeded that of the British. Harry, fearing that the French might take
it in their heads to set upon him again, as they were still so much
superior in number, ordered them below, and battened down the hatches
upon them all, except the surgeon and his mate, whom he kept to assist
his own in dressing the wounds of the men. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> looking amongst the
slain of his crew, Harry observed amongst them the stiffened corpse of
poor Bill Curtis. Harry could not help shedding a tear to the memory
of this brave fellow, who had so nobly seconded him in the time of
need. Bill was covered with gore; but an air of defiance was still
seated upon his countenance, and his hand still firmly grasped his
cutlass, which had that day been wielded with so much success against
the enemies of his country. The old quartermaster came up at this
moment, and Harry, shaking him by the hand, said to him, “I believe
we must have you tried by court-martial, for disobedience of orders.
However,” he added, more seriously, “I believe, had it not been for
your disobedience of orders, we should have all been in the state of
that poor fellow,” pointing to Bill.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said the old quartermaster with a sigh, “a braver fellow never
stepped in a black leather shoe. However, it’s a road we must travel
once; and where die better than fighting for one’s country? For my
part, I would sooner die on a ship’s deck, with the thunder of the
cannon sounding in my ears, than on a bed of the finest down.”</p>

<p>The people on the shore, seeing that the danger was over, and that the
British had gained the victory, had now manned several boats, and were
approaching the ships. In the foremost of these was old Ben, who, being
the proprietor of the village in which he lived, took upon himself, on
all expeditions by sea, the office of commodore of the fleet.</p>

<p>“A noble fellow the captain of that there little craft,” exclaimed
Ben, as he approached the <i>Hawk</i>; “he deserves to be made an admiral,
whoever he is. Gracious Heaven, there is my own nephew, Harry!” cried
he, springing up the fore chains.</p>

<p>“My own uncle, Ben!” exclaimed Harry, springing forward to embrace him.
Cordial, indeed, was the meeting of the uncle and nephew; and perhaps
it were difficult to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> which was the greater&mdash;the joy of the
nephew, or the pride of the uncle.</p>

<p>“But you are all blood, Harry,” said the uncle&mdash;“you must be wounded.”</p>

<p>“A mere scratch,” said Harry; “but some of my poor fellows have
suffered; but, as the wind favours, we had better get the vessels into
the harbour.”</p>

<p>The news of the engagement had spread like wildfire through the
country; and, as the vessels approached the harbour, crowds of people
were waiting to cheer the gallant fellows who had fought so nobly.
The wounded were immediately conveyed on shore and distributed among
the inhabitants, who were eagerly striving which should receive them;
whilst those who had fallen, both French and English, were decently
interred, side by side, in that narrow house where all feuds and
animosities are buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>The rest of our story is soon told. Harry, soon after the engagement,
was united to Maria, with the consent of all parties. For some time
after his marriage, he still went to sea; but, on the decease of
Maria’s father, his property devolving upon him, he retired to enjoy
the society of his amiable wife, and that domestic repose to which his
toils and labours so well entitled him. Clark, the first lieutenant,
having fallen in battle, on Harry’s giving up the service, Archer
was promoted to the command of the <i>Hawk</i>, and he soon after married
Susan, Harry’s sister. As for the old quartermaster, who had borne so
distinguished a part in the engagement, he was at last prevailed upon
by Harry to take up his abode in a beautiful cottage upon his estate.
A clear stream runs by the cottage door, and the situation commands
a fine view of the sea; and the old man may still frequently be seen
sitting at his cottage door, on a summer evening, enjoying the beauties
of the scene; or, if you rise soon enough, you may perhaps see him
taking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> morning walk along the beach, with his spy-glass in his
hand. His chief delight, however, is in Harry’s house, where he is
quite at home. He is particularly attached to Harry’s children, who are
his inseparable companions; and the old man may frequently be seen with
one on each knee, recounting to them the exploits of his former days,
some of which we may, at some future period, communicate to the reader.</p>

<p>As for the French prisoners, a peace with England soon put a period to
their captivity; but, when their release came, so much had the people
of the place endeared themselves to them by their kindness, that many
of them resolved to marry and settle in the neighbourhood. And to this
day may still be seen, in the village of C&mdash;&mdash;, some remnants of the
victory of the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p><b>Transcribers Notes:</b></p>
<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired.</p>
<p>Spelling and hyphenation is inconsistent throughout the text
(examples: wouldna, wudna, wadna; death-bed, deathbed; visitor,
visiter). No attempt was made to change or normalize the spelling,
but the following apparent printing errors were corrected:</p>
<ul>
  <li>page 18: removed extra word “the” (...and it was manifest that
           never a drop of anything)</li>
  <li>page 64: accent added to protegé</li>
  <li>page 135: “Robin-a-Dee” changed to “Robin-a-Ree”</li>
  <li>page 156: “nnavailing” changed to “unavailing” (how unavailing
            all the means he could employ)</li>
  <li>page 183: “aud” changed to “and” (his purpose seemed shaken, and
            he looked around him)</li>
  <li>page 199: “a” added; apparently missed scanning edge of page (A
            British merchant is a citizen of the world)</li>
  <li>page 212: “pity you” apparently cut off by printer; re-added from
            a later printing.</li>
  <li>page 219: “minntes” changed to “minutes” (The few minutes became
            an hour.)</li>
